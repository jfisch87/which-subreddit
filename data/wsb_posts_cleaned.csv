Why should any American company ever act responsibly again?,fxw3uz,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxw3uz/why_should_any_american_company_ever_act/,"Whats the point of good corporate governance and fiscal responsibility? The companies that leveraged themselves to the moon, did stock buybacks to hyper-inflate their stock price, live on constant debt instead of good balance sheets are now being bailed out by unlimited QE. Free money to cover your mistakes. Why would anyone run a good business ever again? Just cheat and scheme and get bailed out later.

Edit: I am truly honored to be the number 1 post on WSB. To get validation from you autists and retards, the greatest American generation, is the peak moment of my life. Thank you all.

Edit 2: Many of you are saying this post is socialist. It is anti-capitalist. It is anti-wall street. It is none of that. My post is in fact about fixing capitalism so it is done the right way. Don't reward companies that are managed poorly and don't invest their profits wisely. Capitalism is about survival of the fittest and rewarding the winners not the schemers and cheaters. I'd rather have a profitable company that pays its workers livable wages, doesn't use sweat shop labor, doesn't pollute our environment, gives good quality healthcare, paid family leave, sick leave, maternity/paternity leave, reinvests in improving infrastructure, keeps low debt to equity, and has a 12 month emergency fund for a black swan event. Not companies that give all the money to the CEO and Board and nothing to the workers, do stock buy-backs with profits instead of improving infrastructure or saving for emergency funds. Let the greedy poorly run companies fail so we can invest only in good quality companies that treat their workers well. We will all make tons of profits in the market with well run companies and main street America will also be able to live a decent quality life. 

Edit 3: I am not a salty bear. In fact I want the market to do well. But this is not the way. Bailing out weak companies that didn't save for a black swan event because of CEO greed is just making this bubble bigger and bigger and it will only pop worse later on. JPow will ruin our market and the economy with this fake bubble with his printer. Let the market be free so we can shed weak companies and true capitalism can see a rise of the strong companies and the market can moon again.

JPow and his printer are really helping the Wall street elite. Jpow doesn't care about you. Now the tax payers are bailing out shadow banking. Junk bonds are risky loans that private equity, hedge funds, and other shadow banking institutions give out to desperate companies that can't get loans from regular banks anymore. That's why junk bonds are shadow banking instead of traditional banking. JPow is using his unlimited printer to BAILOUT and give free money to the shadiest and greediest characters of wall street and society in general - private equity, hedge fund managers, shady billionaires.

PE, hedgies, shady billionaires were screwed because the economy just halted and companies were going to default on these risky loans since they had no revenue coming in. This is who JPow is helping. He just bailed them all out by buying these risky junk bonds on the back of the American tax payer. You may become homeless and starve, but private equity, hedge fund managers, and shady billionaires will be made whole by the fed.",1586480459.0,2921,flyhotman,1,wsb,1

I found out about trading CFDs 4 years ago and thought great this looks easy. In my first year I blew an account worth $10k. Next few years I lost $25k. Last year I tried trading US stocks and indices and lost about $20k. 

I then discovered the holy grail, the slow stochastic indicator and the relative vigor index. I used these tool to claw back the money I lost and made $15k profit. I got excited and quit my job.

Then I found out that these indicators dont work when markets are trending or parabolic. So i lost $45K in 3 months.

Ive maxed out my credit card, I have a personal loan to pay off and no job. Oh btw I also got scammed $10k by a phony lawyer in 2014. I never went to College, I am a unskilled worker.

My broker (Questrade) wants me to sign an NDA saying I won't talk shit about them after offering me $1200 USD as compensation for losing $50000 from outages,frz0fp,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/frz0fp/my_broker_questrade_wants_me_to_sign_an_nda/,"I have bolded two parts that say #**start reading here** and #**stop reading here** for the original post since due to all these edits it has become a bit difficult to read. HOWEVER, please read the entire post with edits once you are done to get additional information and to see some of the rebuttals from Questrade and their legal team. Thank you.


_____________________________

**Was contacted by their legal department, please scroll to the bottom of this post for my trading activity that day.**

edit 4: Guys if you want to help get the word out and potentially save other Canadians from signing up with this nightmare of a broker **please tweet this thread at Questrade or Business Insider or marketwatch or bloomberg or anyone else that can write about it.** I don't have an active twitter account so can't really do it myself but would appreciate it immensely. 

_________________________________________________________________
Edit: lmao, I just got an email telling me to delete these posts or risk legal action. One sec let me reply.


edit 2: This is the email they sent me:

>I have just been notified that you have posted information from our private discussions on Reddit.  These discussions were confidential and constituted good faith attempt to resolve your complaint. Your Reddit posts are inaccurate, misleading and contain defamatory content. As we discussed, you incurred a loss as a result of trading in high risk options, which you failed to mention in your posts.

>We ask that you remove these posts immediately and you cease to use social media to post defamatory and misleading statements about Questrade in an attempt to extort funds from the company. If you do not remove these posts, you are put on notice that this will become a legal matter. Our legal department are already investigating two prior posts you made where you stated that you were ready to ""burn down the building"" as well as making the following statement: ‚Äú if I can‚Äôt get my money back I‚Äôll be sure they lose an equal amount in whatever way I can.'' 

>If we do not receive your confirmation by 12pm on March 31, 2020, that you will discontinue posting defamatory content on social media, you will leave us no choice than to commence legal action. 

>To keep things in perspective, the world is reeling from a tragic situation.  Thousands of people have lost their lives.  Our staff have been working around the clock to help our clients get through this unprecedented crisis.  In response to our genuine attempts to find an amicable solution, you have threatened and insulted our staff.  I urge you to think about your actions.

__________________________________________________________
I replied that I'll go through all my posts and comments and edit any lies I may have said unintentionally.

But just to clarify guys **the position that I held was 0DTE options purchased day of. This is obviously a high risk position.** Options in general are. If I had purchased and ETF or stock then I obviously would not have incurred such a loss. I just want to make that clear.

__________________________________________________________
#**START READING HERE**
I had a 0 DTE options position worth around $50000 CAD that I opened that day. My broker (Questrade) had serious outages for hours that day (and for 3 days in the previous week) leaving many clients unable to access their positions. 

My position expired worthless and I was obviously very upset that I couldn't access such a volatile position for multiple hours. 
_______________________________________________________________

(*note*: I was able to access the position before it expired worthless, my point is that I was unable to access it for even 1 second is unacceptable, the position didn't expire worthless because I couldn't access it at all for the entire day. Just putting this in in case they think this is the defamatory part. Again, these were risky 0DTE OTM options. They carried significant risk regardless) 

*edit 6:* I was able to access the position before it expired worthless. They were not down for an entire trading day. I just had trouble exiting the position during outages and during times when I could've taken a significantly smaller loss. By the time I was able to exit the position I got around $2500 CAD for it. I just want to make this clear. 

Again my issue and the larger point I am trying to make is not that I lost money but rather that the positions could not be accessed for a long time which is unacceptable. If I had made 500k from this trade I wouldn't be complaining but I would still be scared shitless that my broker keeps going down. 

________________________________________________________________

I wrote to their compliance department while also commenting everywhere on their sub warning clients and potential not to trade with Questrade because of this. The previous week after losing $10000 from a similar issue I asked a CS rep for $200 in compensation (the commissions from that day) and they refused.

After I made such a scene on the questrade subreddit the mod reached out to me to have someone call me to discuss my issues. 

After a phone call and a short email chain he requested I delete all my negative comments because there was clearly a ""bias"" being shown. 

I complied in order to see what their compensation offer would be. 

Their offer? $1200 USD.

My commissions for the past month plus ~$350.


In addition I would have to sign an NDA

Here's the relevant part:

https://imgur.com/a/q0vGiw0



The Releasor(s) further agree(s) to do the following:

a)	immediately refrain from making or posting negative comments about Questrade; and

b)	within two (2) days of executing the Release, remove all negative comments made on internet websites, including but not limited to blogs and to social media such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter (collectively referred to as ‚ÄúSocial Media‚Äù), about the Releasee, to the satisfaction of the Releasee.







What a fucking joke. 


I am still waiting to hear back from compliance but I'm not holding my breath for a real offer. 

Maybe this gives all you guys who got ruined from Robinhood's outages some hope. Maybe you can get back all your Robinhood commissions. 

On a serious note though, if you were affected by Questrade's incompetence over the last few weeks check out my profile. I've made a small guide on how you can formally submit a complaint and get some kind of compensation. I'm sure for some of you the few hundred dollars is worth it. But even if not I've included steps you can take to potentially get a better offer through the ombudsman for banking. 

Best of luck.

edit 3: [This is a link to the full ~~NDA~~ release if you are interested](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/frz0fp/my_broker_questrade_wants_me_to_sign_an_nda/flz1e38/)

**Someone (I think Questrade) sent Reddit a DCMA Takedown Notice to this so it is no longer viewable**

edit 5: So apparently this isn't an NDA but rather just a standard release. It was referred to as a non-disclosure waiver so I thought that meant NDA. My bad.



______________________________________________________


**edit 7:**

Questrade just posted this in their sub:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Questrade/comments/fsi5we/response_from_questrade/

>""The story being circulated by a customer on social media is factually incorrect.

>These losses were due to this customers trading behaviour while our platforms were fully operational.
We will not tolerate any spam, hateful language or unfounded disparagement or harassment.""

Essentially saying that I'm lying. 

Interestingly I have this email from the rep that offered me $1200. 

""I did not see the technical issues as being that much of a factor in terms of losses. Lot of the trades were done after the technical issues. In some cases the delays may have hurt you and some cases got you better pricing. Again trading related gains or losses are not relevant in technical issues as they are not in our control nor can we take your gains if it works in your favor.""


So my question is that if ""These losses were due to this customers trading behaviour while our platforms were fully operational."" why in the email offering me compensation the rep said that the technical issues were not ""that much of a factor"" instead of saying that they were not a factor at all? 

Any downtime at all is unacceptable but I find it laughable that I am being accused of defamatory statements when Questrade writes this kind of response lmfao.




**edit 8**: Was contacted by their legal team. They sent me this and asked permission to post my trading activity and log in activity. I of courses said they could and to be completely transparent I will post it here as well:

Questrade raped and murdered a young girl in 1990,fu0gup,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fu0gup/questrade_raped_and_murdered_a_young_girl_in_1990/,"Now I know what you are saying. That is ridiculous. An online brokerage with no physical, corporeal form founded in 1999 could not have possibly committed this heinous felony 30 years ago.

But has Questrade ever denied the allegation? Have they ever said, ""We didn't rape or murder that innocent gradeschooler""?

I think Questrade's silence on the matter speaks volumes.

edit: Dear Questrade in-house or outside counsel, QT public relations, or whomever else carries QT's (possibly bloody) water: I am specifically referring to the corporation Questrade as possibly being a felonious, no good sexual predator, not any individual human person currently or formerly associated with your employer/client. I don't even know that any human being would consciously choose to trade their labor with such a possibly vampirous entity.

Side note: I spoke to Vanguard. He won't have margin to exercise, so they'll close out his position and his account will probably sit there with a fat 20M+ until it gets sent to probate and his family members kill each other over it.

1. The put money is raining right now so load up. But it's getting worse everyday as premiums get higher. Don't hold over night unless you got long dated exps. And don't go full retard right now and sell calls, we will have big bounces to come. 

2. Max your fucking 401ks. Just keep fucking buying. Bathe in red ink. You will love it. In 2030 these prices will look ridiculous. I'm still not below where I bought in during the last crash and we got more pain to go. 

3. Use the fucking put money to go long on cheap ass blue chip stonks and you will retire young. This opportunity won't last forever.

4. Money is mostly bullshit, wash your fucking hands and take precautions. Learn to meditate, work out, sleep enough, etc. 

5. Fuck you guys for finally winning.

Edit: this is my first gold and highest upvoted post. Thanks wsb. I'm not going to answer most questions directly sent to me at this pt as I'm getting hammered but do your research. Blue chips are household name companies that are HUGE. If you don't know this lingo gtfo of this subreddit. Bear markets will fucking eat you alive.

A brief explanation of options for stoolies.,frfhlt,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/frfhlt/a_brief_explanation_of_options_for_stoolies/,"With the influx of new traders we're going to see I figured I'd explain some of the basics for you.

Positions:

420 Spy C 4/17. This is a call. A call means you call bullshit on a stock and think it will crash. Use this if you think A stock is overvalued or will crash soon. 4/17 is the expiration date meaning this is how long you have to hold and make money. The closer it gets to the date the more money you can make.

420 Spy P 4/17. This is a put. Think about it as putting your money where your mouth is. If you are putting faith in a company going up you buy puts to the price you think they're going up to. The easiest way to remember this is P= Profits. Buy them when stocks are going to go up. The same expiration date information applies to puts.

DD= Don't Do it. This where users argue against what they believe is going to happen to strengthen their arguments. Anything you read in a dd should be taken as false it is strictly a thought experiment.

Finally, let's talk about IV this is Instant Value. The higher the IV the more likely your position is to make money. The higher the IV the cheaper options are. This is when you want to buy them.",1585552444.0,820,Cagethepanda,1,wsb,1

Well, I‚Äôm working in construction management and this job site I‚Äôm doing is an absolute disaster. So the company has put me in a shack on the construction site to oversee what is going on. This is multiple year project and we just started moving/leveling dirt....I‚Äôve been sitting in this shack for several months basically just scrolling the internet which led me to WSB. Every now and then we have these meetings and I join the call to say no safety issues and work is on schedule. I even got a fat raise for supposedly getting things back on track‚Äî(i haven‚Äôt done shit. Nobody comes in, nobody calls, occasionally I walk around to see if workers are working. I join the meeting and that‚Äôs it. I once missed a meeting once bc I was jacking off in the bathroom)

Ford and GM slept fucking good last night after seeing this disaster. 

The Top reasons people buy trucks

They fucking hunt, do you think a mother fucker dressed in Carhartt would drive this

They do shit like mudding and driving on dirt roads, Elon stop it

They need to haul tools and shit for work, nobody and I mean nobody is pulling up on a job site with this fucking thing.

They pull campers and trailers, you think the lame ass dude pulling a camper arrives at  Yogi Bear Park with the family in the Cyber punk truck

They have a small dick, these fucks want something more flashy, women need to know they have money, a 40k garbage can on wheels won't cut it.

 I showed this truck to my test group of Beckys they thought it was movie prop. I told one of them, imagine we are on a date and the truck breaks down on the way home,  lucky for us I got an ATV charging in the back and I can give you a ride home still. She left me on ""unread""

Overall this truck fucks.

The only use I can think of for this truck is for local shoot outs, the homies can use the flat bed top as a shield. Sadly the windows don't catch bullets right now so put the new guys in the front.

Modern portfolio theory has been based on the foundational idea for the past 3 decades that both equities and bonds are inversely correlated. However, as some people have realized, both stocks and bonds are both increasing in value and decreasing in value at the same time.[\[1\]](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/upshot/markets-weird-coronavirus.html) This approach to investing is used pretty much in everyone's 401K, target date retirement plans, or other forms of passive investing. If both bonds and equities are losing value, what will happen to firms implementing these strategies on a more generalized basis known as risk-parity? Firms such as Bridgewater, Bluecrest, and H2O assets have been blowing up. \[[2](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-14/dalio-s-macro-fund-plunged-about-20-this-year-as-market-tanked),[3](https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2020-03-13/bluecrest-shrinks-from-relative-value-trades-amid-losses-exits)\]

Liquidity has been drying up in the markets for the past two weeks.[\[4\]](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-14/traders-nightmare-liquidity-vanished-when-they-needed-it-most) The liquidity crisis has been in the making since the 2008 financial crisis, after the passage of Dodd-Frank and Basel III. Regulations intended to regulate the financial industry have instead created the one of the largest backstops to Fed intervention as the Fed tried to pump liquidity into the market through repo operations. What is a repo?

>A repo is a secured loan contract that is collateralized by a security. A repo transaction facilitates the sale and future repurchase of the security that serves as collateral between the two parties: (1) the borrower who owns a security and seeks cash and (2) the lender who receives the security as collateral when lending the cash. The cash borrower sells securities to the cash lender with the agreement to repurchase them at the maturity date. Over the course of the transaction, the cash borrower retains the ownership of the security. On the maturity date, the borrower returns the cash with interest to the lender and the collateral is returned from the lender to the borrower.[\[5\]](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2018027pap.pdf)

Banks like Bank of New York Mellon and JP Morgan Chase act as a clearing bank to provide this liquidity to other lenders through a triparty agreement.\[[6](https://www.jpmorgan.com/jpmpdf/1320634324649.pdf)\] In short, existing regulations make it unfavorable to take on additional repos due to capital reserve requirement ratios, creating a liquidity crunch.\[[7](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-03-12/financial-markets-need-temporary-close-like-the-one-after-9-11),[8](https://www.biancoresearch.com/the-moment-in-this-decline-has-arrived-2/),[9](https://www.jpmorgan.com/jpmpdf/1320634324649.pdf)\] What has the Fed done to address this in light of these facts?

>In light of the shift to an ample reserves regime, the Board has reduced reserve requirement ratios to zero percent effective on March 26, the beginning of the next reserve maintenance period.[\[10\]](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200315b.htm)

**II. Signs of Exhaustion & The Upcoming Bounce is a Trap, We Have Far More to Go**

A simple indicator to use is the relative strength index (RSI) that a lot of WSB is familiar with. RSI is not the be all and end all. There's tons of indicators that also are indicating we are at a very oversold point.

[SPY 1 Yr\/1 Day RSI](https://preview.redd.it/vshsz3wyd1o41.png?width=2086&format=png&auto=webp&s=a122fdedb45c84cc441132aa0d0a7265476c4c22)

Given selling waves, there are areas of key support and resistance. For reference, I have not changed key lines since my original charts except for the colors. You can check in my previous posts. 247.94 has been critically an area that has been contested many times, as seen in the figure below. For those that bought calls during the witching day, RIP my fellow autists. The rejection of 247.94 and the continued selling below 233.86 signals to me more downside, albeit, it's getting exhausted. Thus, I expect the next area in which we start rallying is 213.

[SPY 10 Day\/30 min](https://preview.redd.it/rcwrkh7ud1o41.png?width=2032&format=png&auto=webp&s=70952d3b14635c52467515b8ef2f6f6a004a4f4f)

Another contrarian indicator for buying calls is that notable people in finance have also closed their shorts. These include Jeffery Gundlach, Kevin Muir, and Raoul Pal.\[[11](https://twitter.com/TruthGundlach/status/1240394134717947905),[12](https://themacrotourist.substack.com/p/governments-are-panicking),[13](https://twitter.com/realvision/status/1240688338912169990)\]

**III. The Dollar, Gold, and Oil**

As previously stated, cash is being hoarded by not only primary banks, but central banks around the world. This in turn has created a boom in the dollar's strength, despite limitless injections of cash (if you think 1 trillion of Repo is the ceiling, think again) by the Fed.

[DXY](https://preview.redd.it/477uixirq1o41.png?width=2600&format=png&auto=webp&s=173721c0bd69a6f277493baf0dfc04b59570f7d6)

Despite being in a deflationary environment, the DXY has not achieved such levels since 2003. Given the dollar shortage around the world, it is not inconceivable that we reach levels of around 105-107. For disclosure, I have taken a long position in UUP. However, with all parabolic moves, they end in a large drop. To summarize, the Fed needs to take action on its own currency due to the havoc it's causing globally, and will need to crush the value of the dollar, which will likely coincide with the time that we near 180.

If we are indeed headed towards 180, then gold will keep selling off. WSB literally screams bloody guhhhhhh when gold sells off. However, gold has been having an amazing run and has broken out of its long term channel. In times of distress and with margin calls, heavy selling of equities selling off of gold in order to raise cash. As previously noted, in this deflationary environment, everything is selling off from stocks, to bonds, to gold. 

[\/GC Futures Contracts 5 Yr\/1 Wk](https://preview.redd.it/9rp9fgaes1o41.png?width=2054&format=png&auto=webp&s=cbbf359bb80476aca2490bb6f830de17d4f3dfd4)

What about oil? Given the fall out of the risk parity structure, I'm no longer using TLT inflows/outflows as an indicator. I've realized that energy **is** the economy. Closely following commodities such as light crude which follow supply and demand more closely have provided a much better leading indicator as to what will happen in equities. Given that, oil will also most likely hit a relief rally. But ultimately, we have seen it reach as low $19/barrel during intraday trading.

[\/CL Futures Contracts 1 Yr\/1 D](https://preview.redd.it/vcafxqons1o41.png?width=2054&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b8f7580afe768b72d41fd3b93d22011d133c220)

**IV. The Next 5 Years**

In short, the recovery from this deflationary environment will take years to recover from. The trend down will not be without large bumps. We cannot compare this on the scale of the 2008 financial crisis. This is on the order of 1929. Once we hit near 180, the Fed crushes the dollar, we are in a high likelihood of hitting increased inflation, or stagflation. At this point the Fed will be backed into a corner and forced to raise rates. My targets for gold are around 1250-1300. It may possibly go near to 1000. Oil could conceivably go as low as $15-17/barrel, so don't go all in on the recovery bounce. No matter what, the current rise in gold will be a trap. The continued selling in the S&P is a trap, will bounce, forming another trap, before continuing our painful downtrend.

I haven't even mentioned coronavirus and unemployment until now. I've stated previously we are on track to hit around at least 10,000 coronavirus cases by the end of this month. It's looking closer to now 20-30,000. Next month we are looking to at least 100,000 by the end of the April. We might hit 1,000,000 by May or June.

**tl;dr We're going to have a major reflexive rally starting around 213, all the way back to at least to 250, and possibly 270. WSB is going to lose their minds holding their puts, and then load up on calls, declaring we've reached a bottom in the stock market. The next move will be put in place for the next leg down to 182, where certain actors will steal all your tendies on the way down. Also Monday might be another circuit breaker.**

**tl;dr of tl;dr Big bounce incoming. Bear trap starting 213. Then bull trap up around 250-270. We're going down to around 182.**

**tl;dr of tl;dr of tl;dr WSB will be screwed both left and right before they can say guh.**

&#x200B;

Update 1 3/22/2020 - Limit down 3 minutes of futures. Likely hit -7% circuit breaker on the cash open on Monday at 213 as stated previously.

Do not think we will hit the 2nd circuit breaker at 199.06. Thinking we bounce, not too much, but stabilize at least around 202.97.

Update 2 3/23/20 9:08 - Watching the vote before making any moves.

9:40 - sold 25% of my SPY puts and 50% of my VXX calls

9:45 - sold another 50% of SPY puts

9:50 - just holding 25% SPY puts now and waiting for the vote/other developments

11:50 - Selling all puts.

Starting my long position.

11:55 - Sold USO puts.

12:00 - Purchased VXX puts to vega hedge.

2:45 - Might sell calls EOD. Looks like a lot of positioning for another leg down before going back up.

It's pretty common to shake things out in order to make people to sell positions. Just FYI, I do intraday trading. If you can't, just wait for EOD for the next positioning.

3:05 - Seeing a massive short on gold. Large amounts of calls on treasuries. And extremely large positioning for more shorts on SPY/SPX.

Will flip into puts.

Lot of people keep DM'ing me. I'm only going to do this once.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uvs5tkje1ho41.png?width=2470&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6b632556ca04a26e4e08fb2c9223bfcb84e0901

That said, I'm going back into puts. Just goes to show how tricky the game is.

3:45 - As more shorts cover, going to sell the calls and then flip into puts around the last few min of close.

Hope you guys made some money on the cover and got some puts. I'll write a short update later explaining how they set up tomorrow, especially with the VIX dropping so much.

3/24/20 - So the rally begins. Unfortunately misread the options volume. The clearest signal was the VIX dropping the past few days even though we kept swinging lower, which suggested that large gap downs were mostly over and the rally is getting started.

Going to hold my puts since they are longer dated. Going to get a few short term calls to ride this wave.

10:20 - VIX still falling, possibility of a major short squeeze coming in if SPY breaks out over 238-239.

10:45 - Opened a small GLD short, late April expiration.

10:50 - Sold calls, just waiting, not sure if we break 238.

If we go above 240, going back into calls. See room going to 247 or 269. Otherwise, going to start adding to my puts.

https://preview.redd.it/ag5s0hccxmo41.png?width=2032&format=png&auto=webp&s=aad730db4164720483a8b60056243d6e4a8a0cab

11:10 - Averaging a little on my puts here. Again, difficult to time the entries. Do not recommend going all in at a single time. Still watching around 240 closely.

11:50 - Looks like it's closing. Still going to wait a little bit.

12:10 - Averaged down more puts. Have a little powder left, we'll see what happens for the rest of today and tomorrow.

2:40 - Closed positions, sitting on cash. Waiting to see what EOD holds. Really hard trading days.

3:00 - Last update. What I'm trying to do here posting some thoughts is for you guys to take a look at things and make some hypotheses before trading. Getting a lot of comments and replies complaining. If you're tailing, yes there is risk involved. I've mentioned sizing appropriately, and locking in profits. Those will help you get consistent gains.

https://preview.redd.it/yktrcoazjpo41.png?width=1210&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d6f0272712a2d17d45e033273a369bc164e2477

Bounced off 10 year trendline at around 246, pretty close to 247. Unless we break through that the rally is over. Given that, could still see us going to 270.

3/25/20 - I wouldn't read too much into the early moves. Be careful of the shakeouts.

Still long. Price target, 269. When does the month end? Why is that important?

12:45 - out calls.

12:50 - adding a tranche of SPY puts. Adding GLD puts.

1:00 est - saving rest of my dry powder to average if we still continue to 270. Think we drop off a cliff after the end of the quarter.

Just a little humor... hedge funds and other market makers [right now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAf0QnLFS7Q).

2:00pm - Keep an eye on TLT and VXX...

3:50pm - Retrace to the 10 yr trend line. Question is if we continue going down or bounce. So I'm going to explain again, haven't changed these lines. Check the charts from earlier.

https://preview.redd.it/9qiqyndtivo41.png?width=1210&format=png&auto=webp&s=55cf84f2b9f5a8099adf8368d9f3034b0e3c4ae4

3/26/20 - Another retest of the 10 yr trendline. If it can go over and hold, can see us moving higher.

9:30 - Probably going to buy calls close to the open. Not too sure, seems like another trap setting up. Might instead load up on more puts later today.

In terms of unemployment, was expecting close to double. Data doesn't seem to line up. That's why we're bouncing. California reported 1 million yesterday alone, and unemployment estimates were 1.6 million? Sure.

Waiting a little to see the price action first.

Treasuries increasing and oil going down?

9:47 - Added more to GLD puts.

10:11 - Adding more SPY puts and IWM puts.

10:21 - Adding more puts.

11:37 - Relax guys, this move has been expected. Take care of yourselves. Eat something, take a walk. Play some video games. Don't stare at a chart all day.

If you have some family or close friends, advise them not to buy into this rally. I've had my immediate family cash out or switch today into Treasury bonds/TIPS.

4:00pm - Don't doubt your vibe.

For those that keep asking about my vibe... yes, we could hit 270. I literally said we could hit 270 when we were at 218. There was a lot of doubt. Just sort by best and look at the comments. Can we go to 180 from 270? Yes. I mentioned that EOM is important.

Here's another prediction. VIX will hit ATH again.

2:55pm EST - For DM's chat is not working now. Will try to get back later tonight.

Here it  is: [How big is a mole?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEl4jeETVmg) (the relevant drawing can be found around the 3:20 mark). Also, here is a [gif.](https://media.giphy.com/media/Y0O9TgOM9hoBy/giphy.gif)

[and here's proof if you care i guess.](https://imgur.com/a/PwuxN4Y)

I  came across this sub randomly while scrolling years ago and basically  did a double take, since the logo (with hair and different color suit)  was not drawn by me, it was pretty clearly copied from the TedEd  animation and I recognized it anyway. I had no idea what to do with the  information that an old piece of art I made was plagiarized and being  used for a logo of a sub whose purpose I can't quite understand, so I  just kept it to myself as a weird thing that happened.

Someone  alerted me to the fact that the logo has recently been changed, and tbh  I was kinda bummed lol. I feel compelled to state that legally I don't  own the original artwork, that would be TedEd, so if it was flagged for  copyright I can't help you. but if it were up to me you'd have my  blessing.",1585019765.0,635,ItalianVillageVinnie,1,wsb,1

I walked into work and I received a text that over the weekend a close friend of my friend took his life due to his losses. My friend had mentioned that the guy was making a lot of money with the markets being the way it was and became more delusional in life as he traded. 

He must have gotten hit the past few weeks and looked for a way out even though he wasn‚Äôt showing signs of it. No note but it was known he was in the red a lot.

The market makes a bunch of money and loses a bunch of money. It is zero sum in the end but you cannot buy back your life. Be safe, be smart, and be sensible.

Update** Robinhood has not threatened to sue or take legal action against me yet if I do not pay. I informed them that I will use my $1k worth of CHEGG stock towards the margin call.

Update2** I have transferred $120USD to show robinhood I do intend to make small payments overtime. In case any lawsuit comes up. This combined with the $1k worth of CHEGG stock which robinhood THEMSELVES offered to accept is proof of my intention to make payments.



I will continue to update this in case this happens to any of you. So that you will be able to see the time-line of events and prevent this from happening again.


For those of you wondering - This was the notification I got early this morning. This was on top of the 170k.

Update** After talking via email(robinhood won't contact you over the phone).
Robinhood has given me the spread leg worth of Amazon stock to sell back to the market. 

I have sold the stock back to the market and am now letting the opposite leg of the spread ride to see If I can make it back into a profitable position during power hour.

**Update if Amazon closes above $1,600USD I will be okay. If not I'll have to pay $2000USD to avoid a continued margin call


***Update Robinhood contacted me and was very helpful. I was assigned $ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY-SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS to pay. The broker actually gives you the opportunity to decide how you want to pay. This is called legging out instead of flatly closing both sides of the trade, which can be beneficial is some trading strategies. 

This all started with a Yolo recommendation from another WSB redditor. Unfortunately, due the time I closed out of each leg I still lost roughly $2k.(I think I'm still not sure yet) Which is about 50% of my $5k account. 

On Monday I will update everyone whether or not I'm still under a margin maintenance call. If not I should still have about $2k or $3k left. Anyone have any ideas for a good yolo?

Some generic garbage about well known investment theories over multiple decades.  How are they relevant to a 2 week hail mary prediction?  They're not, but it gives the illusion I know what I'm talking about.

Here is a [bearish article](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/stock-market-hasnt-seen-absolute-bottom-yet-says-mark-mobius-2020-04-14?mod=mw_quote_news) that I'm sure no one will take the time to read, but due to confirmation bias, put holders will automatically agree with.

**II. Technical analysis**

Generic fortune telling garbage such as ""support"" and ""resistance"" that makes believing in astrology look reasonable by comparison.  (Number above where we are) is resistance.  (Number below where we are) is support.  Doesn't matter if we collapse through support like it's nothing or break through resistance like it's nothing, there is nothing that will prove the generic statements about support and resistance wrong.  

Also I drew some fancy lines that shows this is indeed a bull trap.

**III. Some other useless garbage about other markets***

Mention commodities, including precious metals, perhaps treasuries to make oneself seem knowledgeable.  More thoughts on what COULD happen versus what will really happen.

**TLDR: this is a hail mary prediction that will gain me a cult following if I'm right and I'll just try again on a new account if I'm wrong. God I love reddit and this sub.**

Edit:  The rally from below 2200 to present levels was perfectly predictable, if you looked at fundamentals and technicals.  No fucking way I'll say anything of the sort **BEFORE** the fact but I'm pretending to be a timeless sage in hindsight.

These are interesting levels that I'm keeping an eye on: 2500, 2700, 2950.  What does it mean and what tradeable insight are to be gained from these numbers? lol fuck if I know.

Recession from this virus bullshit is going to come, and those who survive recessions best are those who have managed to keep their jobs. 

It's easy to be distracted by the markets and dream about being able to earn enough money from options trading to retire at age 23, but that isn't happening for 99% of us. There's a lot of survivorship bias here - only those with outrageous gains and losses are really posting here for the lolz. 

I graduated in 2013 and it took me a month to find a job. It paid $35,000 to start.  I almost got fired once from another shitty job because I was lazy and unfocused and the job sucked.

Now she's in advisory at PwC after working really hard and proving her worth at her first job, which only paid $40,000. 

It's easy to goof off at work and be constantly on Reddit and your favorite brokerage website dicking around and not being productive, but you should first and foremost be kicking ass at your job first.

I think it's important for Canadians to know that they could potentially get contacted by the police if they say something to their broker out of frustration or anger. 

People should know what kind of company they are dealing with. 

You can also email the News Tips email on sites with links to these threads if you want.

[Post #2 - Questrade Legal Contacted me](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fsnubq/contacted_by_questrade_legal_team_for_permission/)

This is post 3. 

So in the original email where they mention legal action they accused me of threats, extortion and defamation.

>""We ask that you remove these posts immediately and you cease to use social media to post defamatory and misleading statements about Questrade in an attempt to extort funds from the company. If you do not remove these posts, you are put on notice that this will become a legal matter. Our legal department are already investigating two prior posts you made where you stated that you were ready to ""burn down the building"" as well as making the following statement: ‚Äú if I can‚Äôt get my money back I‚Äôll be sure they lose an equal amount in whatever way I can.''""

Obviously the quotes in the email don't provide full context but the cops understood that and read it back to me. 

Paraphrasing here but this is the comment regarding burning down the building: 

>What is going on with Questrade support? This is such a joke. It pretty much feels like all they're saying is ""too bad so sad"" and ""fuck you"". Honestly getting tired with this.. I feel like I'm going crazy... getting ready to burn down the building. What a joke

So obviously I was saying it as a figure of speech and not serious in anyway regarding it but regardless Questrade took it to the police. 

The other comment about ""if I can't get my money back I'll be sure they lose an equal amount in whatever way I can"" was meant as in them losing potential/current client's commissions. Obviously I didn't mean any harm which I clarified in my reply to the original email. 

Basically the police cautioned me and said they don't think I was serious. 

The call I got was around 1:30am EST and I asked if they usually call this late and the officer said that they were just getting to it cause they had more pressing matters (assuming COVID19). 

Just a waste of police resources in general if you ask me. Especially during this time. Like the guy from the TradeDesk said to me in an email...

>""To keep things in perspective, the world is reeling from a tragic situation.  Thousands of people have lost their lives.  Our staff have been working around the clock to help our clients get through this unprecedented crisis.  In response to our genuine attempts to find an amicable solution, you have threatened and insulted our staff.  I urge you to think about your actions.""

I would urge Questrade to think about their actions. 

The officer also asked me if I was the one writing posts about ""Questrade killing someone's wife""(?) and I think something about Hitler but I was able to clarify that it wasn't me writing those posts and it was other people who were likely upset. 

Just find it pretty ridiculous that police had to waste their time going through screenshots sent by Questrade of their sub... 

Not sure why they would waste the police's time with this but it ultimately resulted in nothing. It was, in my opinion, obvious that those comments were both said out of frustration and I removed them (along with all comments) at the request of a Questrade employee as well anyway. 


I think what people should take away from this though is how poorly Questrade is treating its clients. If I were to phone them and be upset I don't want to be scared of potentially having a criminal charge brought forward on me because they took something I said out of frustration seriously and involved the police. Honestly think their handling of this matter has been incredibly unprofessional throughout. Upsetting to think this was a company I used to admire and recommend to countless people. 

Even just a few days before all this happened I was recommending them to friends - https://imgur.com/a/DHVOHhE

It's amazing to me how poorly they've handled all this and how in less than 3 weeks my opinion of them has done a complete 180. 

What a joke.


Edit: I'm sure you guys worked this out for yourselves but just want to point out how it's weirdly convenient that they saw the ""threats"" last week but the police only contacted me after I refused to take down my posts about them...

Wish me luck, fuckers.

I also want to make it clear that I'm not predicting a bunch of US banks to fail. They're better insulated from this than the rest of the world. The vulnerable ones are abroad, and they're the ones with really lazy lending standards. US banks will be hit, but likely won't tank.

&#x200B;

Forgot to put strike/date at the top: I'm in September BAC $18 puts. Banks will start failing later this year. It's hard to tell which ones will fail, due to the *shadowy* nature of the *shadow lending* market. That, and the dollar will moon. You want positions spoonfed to you? Fuck off. This post is half food for thought, half explanation. Trying to follow the money here is *hard.* If you're lazy, just buy puts on indices like $INDA and $EWG and $EWY: any country that's loaded up on eurodollars.

&#x200B;

Alright, you tards, listen up: this is going to be a long, confusing post.

&#x200B;

First off, I'd like to say that I'm not smart. But that doesn't concern me, because you're not smart, either. I just began reading about repo operations a few days ago. I've seen a few posts on here lately remarking on the repo ops, and a lot of misconceptions about what they *are* and what they're intended to *do*. I've learned all of what I'm going to post here from other users on here and from my own research.

&#x200B;

The most important thing you need to understand about the repo market is that it's a black box. It's an **interbank loan market** **where securities (ideally bonds) are put up as collateral for short-term cash loans**. The transactions are private and the market usually sets the rates. Repurchase agreements are semantically different from fed repos, but **operate in the exact same way.** This is important. Banks, per federal legislation, are required to keep a minimum amount of cash on hand to prevent liquidity issues. The repo market exists as a way to circumvent these requirements; banks run as close to the reserve requirements as possible to maximize their profitability, and sometimes run below the limit. In this case, the bank posts collateral on the repo market in exchange for liquid cash to meet the requirements again.

&#x200B;

In September of last year, the fed was forced to offer hundreds of billions of dollars in repo agreements to banks. This is because the interbank repo interest rate had reached 10% due to liquidity problems. I'm still not sure, and I'm not sure that anyone else is sure, why the liquidity shortage arose, but it did. If I were to hazard a guess, it's because big domestic lenders, sensing volatility abroad, started to pull out of the repo market. Since then, the fed has been, on-and-off, offering repo agreements to large banks (designated banks are called Primary Dealer Banks \[PDBs\]) and they hold a special status and maintain accounts with the fed. Once these PDBs post collateral (again, securities), money (kind of) is transferred temporarily to their fed account. These PDBs then distribute the cash in the interbank repo market (which is anonymous) at a slight profit. The fed repo interest rate was around 1.6%; on Tuesday night, it jumped up to 1.8% because of the emergency demand.

&#x200B;

The fed had planned to cut repo ops to 0 by April of this year, essentially weaning the US banking system off of liquidity infusions. This didn't happen. Due to supply chain disruptions and market volatility, the fed was forced to offer several hundred billion in overnight repo agreements this week to PDBs in an effort to maintain liquidity. In fact, this month is set to hit record repo lending balances. Furthermore, the [fed is expecting another $130b](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/domestic-market-operations/monetary-policy-implementation/repo-reverse-repo-agreements/repurchase-agreement-operational-details#monthly-summary) to be repaid in the next three weeks, sucking even more liquidity out of the market.

Edit: The fed was also pondering establishing a standing clearing house for fed repos to smaller entities like hedge funds. Hopefully, they're walking that idea back, because it's a fucking *terrible* one.

&#x200B;

Now, here's where I learned I was wrong, and this is a point of confusion for some: **the banks don't need the liquidity for themselves.** They need the liquidity for their *borrowers*. See, these PDBs float money anonymously in the repo market to lots and lots of entities, both domestic and foreign. This is *shadow banking*. Remember when I said the repo market is a black box? Right, well, American banks have been lending money to foreign banks that don't have as stringent of regulations as American ones do. In the US, between two US banks, when a loan is written, some percentage of the loan size must be physically transferred over to the borrower (the reserve amount). Between an American bank and a foreign bank, though, no such requirement exists.

&#x200B;

From this discrepancy in regulation, the eurodollar is born. **The eurodollar is imaginary money** that is printed by American banks: when they make a loan to a foreign bank, the loan exists only on the balance sheets. There is no physical manifestation of currency transfer. Consequently, eurodollars get *leveraged to shit*. Instead of the fractional reserve system, the ideal interbank loan system in America, eurodollars can get loaned indefinitely, forever. Eurodollars are paying factory workers, building bridges, and trading as currency. But it's *not* currency. And because eurodollars are what circulate outside the US, real USD are becoming increasingly rare.

&#x200B;

You see, the USD has become the de facto global currency. There's a lot of confidence in it. It backs virtually every exchange of goods or services in the world. Right now, though, emerging markets' banks aren't really using it; they're hoarding it. Additionally, they're accepting *awful* collateral in exchange for eurodollars, because they know the USD has intrinsic value and eurodollars are imaginary. Collateral like subprime loans. Sound familiar? It should, because the 08 crisis was global *because of the international monetary system*. The mortgage defaults here at home were just the impetus - just like the supply chain disruptions this year might be. The subprime mortgage scandal was just the scapegoat for the **underlying fragility of the eurodollar system.**

&#x200B;

Now, PDBs are aware of this. That's one reason they're starting to become stingier with their lending. They know that their borrowers are accepting garbage collateral in exchange for eurodollars. They know that foreign banks are leveraging themselves up to the tits on *low-grade collateral,* which means, in essence, the fed is, by proxy, making out hundreds of billions in loans to banks in places like India for fucking used car loans instead of treasury bonds. So, say that Shyam over in India can't make his car payments this month because he hasn't worked since the quarantine began. And his neighbors all do the same. Without US liquidity injections, channeled through the PDBs and into the shady repo market, that Indian bank will fail.

&#x200B;

Now, that's why it matters that US lenders are pulling out of foreign markets: with supply/manufacturing disruptions and increasing volatility all over the world, foreign banks are direly hurting for liquidity so they can make out loans for businesses and manufacturers and individuals and all sorts of entities. If they don't get this liquidity, they're likely to default. And what happens when these capital groups and small banks die? They default on *their* loans. So on, up the chain. Say JPM takes out $50b against its treasuries from the fed. It then sells that money on the repo market. Eventually, that money finds its way to Yong Jiang over in China, who took out a loan to keep the lights on in the McDonald's Toy factory in Hubei. Well, three months later, sales haven't made up for lost revenue during the quarantine, and Yong Jiang becomes insolvent and defaults on his loan. That default makes its way back up the ladder to JPM. Now, JPM can either default on its loan from the fed (and bonds get dumped on the market) or it can liquidate some of its assets to pay the fed back.

&#x200B;

JPM has made this calculation and decided, fuck no, it wants none of that. The problem is, though, that the loan has already been taken out by Yong Jiang. Say Yong Jiang's bank needs some liquidity because Yong defaults. Well, JPM has stopped taking fed repos because of the risk, so there's no money to buy on the market, and Yong's bank fails. This happens dozens of times, across dozens of countries. Pretty soon, the international banking industry faces systemic collapse. For reference, the global repo market [is valued at $12T](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&ved=2ahUKEwjqgof02IToAhXwm-AKHY3rA8gQFjACegQICxAF&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bis.org%2Fpubl%2Fcgfs59.pdf&usg=AOvVaw21Jay8zD6uNqWJcspNvCXa) USD, and only 3/4 of it is backed by ""pristine collateral"" - government bonds. **That means that $3T of it is in equities or derivatives.** The fed's balance sheet is only *$4T* USD in comparison. Additionally, $.5T is in private capital groups, which are entirely opaque and likely have rotten fucking lending standards. No way to see who they're lending to, or what collateral they're taking.

&#x200B;

We're already seeing this beginning: [India's Yes Bank is about to be nationalized](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-05/india-s-central-bank-to-seize-yes-bank-to-help-revive-lender) due to, you guessed it, *liquidity* problems. It's been involved in shadow lending practices, and American liquidity is starting to dry up across the world. China is also heavily dependent on eurodollars, but I'm not sure how that relationship will shake out. Their economy might be so big and so vital that we're forced to prop them up. If not, China's banking system will go tits up, too.

&#x200B;

The question then becomes, is the fed willing and able to meet global liquidity demands? And beyond this, how do they force PDBs to keep printing eurodollars and continue to assume risk, risk which may violate their fiduciary obligation to shareholders? Trillion-dollar question.

&#x200B;

So, what does all this mean? Who can we short? Honestly, this is hard to say. Personally, I have september puts on BAC for $18, and I'm still looking for anyone else who might be vulnerable. Any of the PDBs with accounts at the fed might be at risk. I'm going to start hunting for SE Asian, African, and South American banks that've been taking repo money. Those are likely to be the most probable to fail. On top of that, as banks start dropping like flies and the global economy tanks, the USD is going to fucking \*moon\*. That's a worthwhile bet, too. The issue here is that the repo market is anonymous, so it's hard to follow the money. If anyone has any recommendations for specific banks or lending groups to target or look into more, please feel free to let me know.

&#x200B;

If the global banking industry started to fail, though, look for it to hit full swing later this year. This is going to be driven by large amounts of defaults that will be spurred by the manufacturing disruptions, the extent of which won't be fully felt until at least midway through this year. Add a few months for missed loan payments, and I'm wagering that you'll see banks start *really* failing by August or September.

&#x200B;

There's a lot here I'm going to continue to research, and if there's anything I've gotten wrong or anything you'd like to add, please speak up and correct me/educate me.

Infinite leverage explained,dqg6xx,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dqg6xx/infinite_leverage_explained/,"I saw a lot of comments on other posts clearly confused about what u/ControlTheNarrative (hereafter CTN) did to bilk RH out of $50k, so I thought I‚Äôd write up a little non-stock/options explanation. This is how he could have done it brick-and-mortar style.

CTN goes into his bank and asks for a personal loan. He only has $2k in cash to show he‚Äôs good for it but when the banker sees he‚Äôs wearing a helmet he assumes that he is safety conscious and writes him a $2k loan, i.e. 2:1 leverage.

CTN now has $4k in cash.

Being a savvy investor, CTN uses the $4k to buy a purebred kitten from a local breeder. On Craigslist he finds a cat lady willing to pay him $3k today in exchange for getting the kitten next year.

CTN goes back into the bank and asks for another loan. ‚ÄúWeren‚Äôt you just here getting a $2k loan?‚Äù the banker asks. CTN self-soothes by rocking in his chair and mumbles ‚ÄúNow I have $3k in cash and a $4k cat, so after considering my $2k debt I have $5k of assets. Can I get a loan for $5k?‚Äù The banker shrugs, ignores an incoming call from the SEC, and writes the loan. ‚ÄúA $5k loan for $5k in assets is 2:1 leverage‚Äù, he thinks, ‚Äúthis seems fine.‚Äù

CTN now has $8k in cash and a $4k cat (promised to the cat lady).

CTN heads to a puppy mill and picks out a purebred pit bull for $8k. On the dark web he finds a guy willing to pay $7.5k today in exchange for the dog when it‚Äôs full grown.

CTN goes back to the bank again. The banker barely looks up from a thick line of white lightning and asks ‚ÄúAnother loan? You owe $7k now you know.‚Äù CTN says ‚ÄúWell I have $7.5k in cash plus this $4k cat and this $8k dog, so after considering my $7k debt I have $12.5k of assets. Can I get a loan for $12.5k? It‚Äôs only 2:1 leverage.‚Äù The banker is too blitzed to do math so he rips off a check. 

CTN now has $20k in cash, a $4k cat (promised to the cat lady), and an $8k dog (promised to Michael Vick).

Next he goes to the local stables. After watching horses mount each other for a while, he buys a thoroughbred foal for $20k. At Bible study that night he meets someone willing to pay him $19k for breeding rights to the horse as an adult.

Back to the bank goes our hero. The banker is getting a little worried now and tells CTN that he owes $19.5k. Let‚Äôs say there‚Äôs also $500 in interest to make it an even $20k owed.

CTN reassures him he knows what he‚Äôs doing by showing his WSB post history. ‚ÄúI have $19k in cash, a $4k cat, an $8k dog, and a $20k horse. After considering my $20k debt I have $31k of assets. How about a loan for $31k?‚Äù The banker shrugs - it‚Äôs just 2:1 leverage - and writes the loan.

CTN now has $50k in cash, a $4k cat (promised to the cat lady), an $8k dog (promised to Michael Vick), and a $20k horse (promised to Mr. Hands).

That night the banker reflects on the enigma that is CTN. It suddenly hits him that the cat, the dog, and the horse are not collateral that the bank can repossess to offset any losses CTN might incur, because they are contractually guaranteed to other people. The bank has given CTN a $50k margin account for only $2k in collateral, or 25:1 leverage! Whoops!

‚ÄúFuck it‚Äù he thinks. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll just put the cash in a safe investment that we can sell to close everything out. I‚Äôll call him tomorrow.‚Äù

Meanwhile CTN takes his $50k cash to the casino, shrieks ‚ÄúYOLO!‚Äù and throws it all on black.

The fact that r/wallstreetbets has been the number 1 ""fastest growing subreddit"" recently should probably set off some warning bells.  May be wise to at least hedge or reconsider the ""stonks only go up"" mantra.

impossible to call a top but can always protect your account from getting blown up.  Right now we are 17% above 200 DMA, in 1999 it went to 50%.  This market has room to get even more retarded so going negative is probably ill advised.  That said, when it drops it'll be epic and I look forward to seeing the fallout.

Everything You May Have Been Too Afraid To Ask About Options,dk2vv4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dk2vv4/everything_you_may_have_been_too_afraid_to_ask/,"I‚Äôve seen a few posts of people wanting to learn more, so I decided to share this information I‚Äôve put together. Most probably know this info already, so for those who don‚Äôt here ya go:

Contract Pricing

Option premiums are derived from two things: intrinsic value (the option‚Äôs inherent value) and time value (the additional premium that is priced into the option). The only factor that influences an option‚Äôs intrinsic value is the underlying stock‚Äôs price vs. the option‚Äôs strike price. Time value is influenced by various factors such as time until expiration, stock price, strike price and interest rates; however, the primary factor influencing time value is the implied volatility. Implied volatility fluctuates the same way prices do; it is relative to the underlying stock and how volatile it is.

Example: Suppose a $50 call option was purchased at a price of $14; currently, the stock is trading at a price of $60 per share.
Intrinsic Value: Since the share price is above the $50 strike price, the owner can exercise the option and buy the stock for $50 per share and immediately sell the stock for $60. The intrinsic value of an option is the difference between the strike price and the price of the stock, which in this case is $10.
Time Value: This is the additional premium that is priced into an option, which represents the amount of time left until expiration. Since the option is priced at $14, the option premium is priced at $4 more than the intrinsic value.

Impact of Implied Volatility

Impact on Premium: Implied volatility represents the anticipated volatility of a stock over the life of the option. As these expectations change, so do the options premiums. As expectations / demand for an option increases, the implied volatility will also rise resulting in high-priced premiums. The opposite is also true, options with lower implied volatility will carry cheaper option prices. In order to make a successful premium trade, buy an option with low implied volatility and sell the option when the implied volatility increases.

Impact on Option Duration: Different types of options result in different reactions to implied volatility. Short-dated options will be less sensitive to implied volatility. Long-dated options will be more sensitive to implied volatility. This is because long-dated options have more time value priced into them whereas short-dated options have less. In order to make a successful premium trade for a short-dated option, buy an option with a higher intrinsic value because time value is less priced in. In order to make a successful premium trade for a long-dated option, buy an option with a low implied volatility because the time value is more priced in; when implied volatility begins to increase, the higher sensitivity will result in a larger, more dramatic premium increase.

Impact on Strike Price: Each strike price will respond differently to changes in implied volatility. Near The Money (NTM) options are most sensitive to changes in implied volatility while options that are further Outside The Money (OTM) or further Inside The Money (ITM) be less sensitive to implied volatility changes.

Implied Volatility and Forecasting: Before initiating an options play, it is beneficial to establish an implied volatility range for the option you will be trading in order to determine what you consider to be low premiums (for buying the contract) and high premiums (for selling the contract) for that specific stock option (it is good practice to also find the mean). Implied volatility moves in cycles, high volatility periods are followed by low volatility periods and vice versa. Investors can use these ranges in order to determine the best time to enter a trade, forecasting is then used to determine a higher implied volatility to exit the trade at. It is important to consider the following when forecasting implied volatility:
- Determine whether the implied volatility is high or low and whether it is rising or falling. As implied volatility reaches extreme highs or lows, it is likely to revert back to its mean.
- It is not uncommon to see implied volatility plateau at highs, check the news and research the company as this can happen ahead of earnings, mergers/acquisitions, and product approvals.
- Consider selling strategies when options are trading with high implied volatility because options premiums will be more expensive.
- Consider buying strategies when options are trading with low implied volatility because options premiums will be less expensive.

The Greeks

The Greeks are a set of risk measures that indicated how exposed an option is to time value decay, implied volatility, and pricing changes in an underlying security. There are five Greek risk measures: Delta, Theta, Vega, Gamma, and Rho:

Delta: This is a measure of the change in an option‚Äôs price or premium resulting from a change in the underlying asset. A high Delta option‚Äôs premium will increase more than a low Delta option‚Äôs premium for every $1 the stock gains; a high Delta option‚Äôs premium will also fall more than a low Delta option‚Äôs premium for every $1 the stock loses. For example, if the Delta is 0.6 then for every $1 the stock rises the premium will rise $0.60. Delta is also commonly used when determining the likelihood of an option being ITM at expiration. For example, an OTM call option with a 0.20 Delta has roughly a 20% chance of being ITM at expiration, whereas a deep ITM call option with a 0.95 Delta has a roughly 95% chance of being ITM at expiration. Lastly, Delta is used when determining directional risk. Positive Deltas are long (buy) market assumptions and negative Deltas are short (sell) market assumptions. Neutral Deltas are neutral market assumptions. There are three main things to keep in mind when considering Delta:
- Delta tends to increase as expiration approaches for near or ATM options.
- Delta is further evaluated by Gamma, which measures Delta‚Äôs rate of change.
- Delta can also change in reaction to implied volatility changes.

Gamma: This measures Delta‚Äôs rate of change over time as well as the rate of change in the underlying asset. Gamma is used to help forecast price moves in the underlying asset. Since Delta values are constantly changing with the underlying asset‚Äôs price, Gamma is used to measure the rate of change and provide traders with an idea of what to expect in the future. Since Gamma is a constant that represents the rate of change of Delta, it is useful for determining the stability of Delta, which can be used to determined the likelihood of an option reaching the strike price at expiration. A good way to think of Gamma is the measure of the stability of an option‚Äôs probability. If Delta represents the probability of being ITM at expiration, Gamma represents the stability of that probability over time. Gamma values are highest for ATM options and lowest for deep ITM or OTM options. For example, suppose that two options have the same Delta value but one option has a high Gamma and one has a low Gamma. The option with the higher Gamma will have a higher risk since an unfavorable move in the underlying asset will have an oversized impact. High Gamma values mean that the option tends to experience volatile swings, which is a bad thing for most traders looking for predictable opportunities. An option with a high Gamma and a 0.75 Delta may have less of a chance of expiring ITM than a low Gamma option with the same Delta. There are three additional things to keep in mind when considering Gamma:
- Gamma is the smallest for deep OTM and deep IMT options.
- Gamma is highest when the option gets near the money.
- Gamma is positive for long options and negative for short options.

Theta: This measures the rate of time decay in the value of an option or its premium. Time decay is the erosion of an option‚Äôs value from the passage of time. As time passes, the chance of an option being profitable or ITM lessens. Time decay tends to accelerate as the expiration date of an option draws closer because there‚Äôs less time left to earn a profit from the trade. Theta is always negative for a single option since time moves in the same direction. Theta is good for sellers and bad for buyers. For example, assume an investor is long an option with a Theta of -0.50. The option‚Äôs price would decrease by $0.50 every day that passes, all else being equal. There are three additional things to keep in mind when considering Theta:
- Theta can be high for OTM options if they carry a lot of implied volatility.
- Theta is typically highest for ATM options since less time is needed to earn a profit with a price move in the underlying stock.
- Theta will increase sharply as time decay accelerates in the last few weeks before expiration and can severely undermine a long option holder‚Äôs position, especially if implied volatility declines at the same time.

Vega: This measures the risk of changes in implied volatility or the forward-looking expected volatility of the underlying asset price. Vega represents the amount that an option contract‚Äôs price changes in reaction to a 1% change in the implied volatility of the underlying asset. While Delta measures the actual price changes, Vega is focused on changes in expectations for future volatility. Higher volatility makes options more expensive since there is a greater likelihood of hitting the strike price at some point. Vega tells us approximately how much an option will increase or decrease in the level of implied volatility. Option sellers benefit from a fall in implied volatility, and option buyers benefit from a rise in implied volatility. Long option traders benefit from pricing being bid up, and short option traders benefit from prices being dig down. This is why long options have a positive Vega and short options have a negative Vega. For example, if the Vega is 0.25 and the implied volatility increase by 1%, then the option‚Äôs bid-ask price should increase by $0.25. If the Vega of an option is greater than the bid-ask spread, then the option is said to offer a competitive spread. This is just one consideration, as too high of a spread could make getting into and out of trades more difficult and/or costly. There are three additional points to keep in mind when considering Vega:
- Vega can increase or decrease without price changes of the underlying asset, due to changes in implied volatility.
- Vega can increase in reaction to quick moves in the underlying asset.
- Vega falls as the option gets closer the expiration.

Rho: This measures the change in option premium due to interest rates. For example, if Rho is 0.25 and interest rates are increased by 1%, the price of the contract would increase by 0.25 / $25. If interest rates are decreased by 1%, the price of the contract would decrease by 0.25 / $25.


Edit:

Clarification per u/NotMeLa

gamma changes dynamically together with delta as underlying asset value changes; it is not constant. Delta cannot change without gamma also changing.

Because of this, you actually contradict yourself later when you state that gamma is lowest when the option is deep ITM/OTM (which is correct), where time value is negligible and changes to option value happen due to changes in intrinsic value, which in turn happens due to changes in underlying asset value.

Edit 2:

Courtesy of u/yuckfoubitch 

A good way to think about delta is that it‚Äôs the change in the price of the option with respect to a change in the price of the underlying, so you can think about it like the first derivative (say velocity of the price). Gamma is the change in the delta of the option with respect to a change in underlying price move, so much like a second derivative (acceleration of the option price). If you want to better understand Greeks you could check out some different options pricing Models, the OG being Black-Scholes. To get the most out of these you‚Äôre going to have to know some partial differential equations or ODE techniques

Options Greeks for Dummies,flgsk1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/flgsk1/options_greeks_for_dummies/,"**Since a lot of new autists are on here blindly buying options and praying that they make them money. hopefully this helps you lose less money**

Let me make this as *simple* as possible. Options Greeks are dimensions of **risk** for different aspects, such as time, price, volatility blah blah. Here is what they are and how you can use them to make better trades.

**DELTA**
domain: price
delta is the greek that has the largest influence over the option, it is a reflection of how the options premium will change as the price of the stock changes. For example, if you buy a call option on a stock that costs 100$ with a delta of .35, you can expect the premium of your option to go up 35 cents if the stock goes up 1$ to 101$.
**DELTA TLDR** delta is the percent risk for the option. multiply it by 100 to get a general percent chance of profit.

**GAMMA**
Gamma is the derivative of Delta , or the instantaneous rate of change for each consecutive increase or decrease in stock price relative to the option. gamma is to delta as acceleration is to velocity in your high school physics class. Basically, GAMMA is **NOT** linear.
For example, you have a stock that costs 100$ with a delta of .35 and a gamma of .05. if the stock goes up 1$, the premium will go up 35 cents and delta will go up to .40, meaning the next 1$ increase will increase the premium 40 cents instead of 35 cents.
**GAMMA TLDR** The derivative of delta, how much delta will change as price increases or decreases.

**THETA**
theta is the domain of time, more specifically the rate of decay. Pay extra attention to theta you autistic fucks because this is the reason you keep losing all your money. Theta is the greek that represents how much your option will decrease every day that passes where your option does not move closer in the money. theta increases as expiration gets closer, so when you buy your option 50% out of the money that expires next week, theta cucked you ten times harder than that same option expiring in 6 months.
For example, your option costs 1.80, and has a theta of .1, 
this is what your premium will look like as you get theta cucked:
Day 1: *1.8
Day 2: *1.7
Day 3: *1.6
you get the point.
**THETA TLDR** HIGH THETA IS BAD FOR OPTION BUYER AND VERY GOOD FOR OPTION SELLER. A THETA CLOSER TO 1 MEANS YOU WILL ALMOST 100% LOSE EVERYTHING.

**VEGA**
Vegas domain is implied volatility. it represents how your option will be influenced by 1% increase or decrease in IV. Say you have an option that cost 1$, with a vega of .05, if the IV goes up 1%, the option will go up to 1.05. NOTICE in the current conditions IV is in the hundreds of percent for everything. SO WHEN THIS SHIT STABILIZES YOUR OPTIONS WILL GET DESTROYED BY VEGA!!
**VEGA TLDR** Implied Volatilities influence over option price. increase in IV is good for buyers and bad for sellers, and vise versa. so in general, low IV options are far more favorable for a buyer.

**RHO**
rho is the domain over interest rates. for newbies, this shit is the least important greek by far, but basically it shows how much your premium will increase or decrease as interest rates go up or down.

**TLDR**
options greeks are used to analyze how various factors such as time, price, volatility, and interest rates will influence the premium on your option. They are crucial for responsible gambling as they can be used to almost immediately assess the risk the option you are buying or selling has, along with the actual potential for profit.
**Use this information to not lose all your money** I will try to answer questions but probably not.

"One year ago today the OptionsSellers fund exploded spectacularly, placing many of its clients in six or seven figure debt.",dxmrnf,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dxmrnf/one_year_ago_today_the_optionssellers_fund/,"A quick recap for those of you who are unfamiliar with the legend:

OptionsSellers.com was a fund that marketed itself as a money manager for mid-upper class folks (doctors, etc) using trading methods that consistently outperform the S&P500. Their strategy? **Selling naked options on crude oil and natural gas.** More specifically they were using a method called the [short strangle](https://i.imgur.com/cWMeEj8.png), selling both put and call options with a wide delta between strike prices. Using this strategy they could rake in the cheddar so long as the price does not move outside the payoff region.  

What could go wrong with this? Apparently nothing, at least for a couple years. To their credit, OptionsSellers had somehow managed to avoid a catastrophic loss event for years while selling naked options on highly volatile commodities. Their returns were so endearing that they attracted hundreds of millionaire clients from all over the country. 

But then November 2018 happened. Natural gas futures spiked tremendously and shatterd the whole fund in minutes (literally minutes). Turns out selling naked options you can't afford to cover is a very bad idea. 

Suddenly clients who had multi-million dollar accounts the day before were receiving emails about owing money. OptionsSellers wasn't answering their calls and the website went offline. They knew it was bad, but how bad? They wouldn't get to find out until [cofounder James Cordier posted this 10 minute video of himself having a mental breakdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNYNMM0hXXY).

SARS vs coronavirus: why it's different this time and the effects on the world economy,f5seog,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f5seog/sars_vs_coronavirus_why_its_different_this_time/,"I see many comparisons of the coronavirus outbreak to SARS everywhere. From the media to analysts to WSB posters, everyone loves to compare this coronavirus outbreak to SARS and say that the economy recovered quickly last time, so it will do the same this time. A lot has been discussed about the supply chain disruptions in [other reddit threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/f07zut/some_specific_details_about_impending_supply/), so I do not think it is necessary to talk about that. The differences between the diseases themselves as well as a potential pandemic breaking out has been discussed at length too, so I don‚Äôt find it necessary to go into that either. What I will do is show how the Chinese economy is much weaker and much different now than when SARS hit in 2003 and focus not too much on the supply side, but mostly on the demand side and the banking industry based on the research I have been doing. I believe that even if factories reopen tomorrow at 100% efficiency (they have been struggling to reopen amidst [labor shortages](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/14/china-coronavirus-its-still-far-from-business-as-usual.html)), coronavirus is completely eradicated, and everyone starts consuming at the same levels that they would have otherwise, the Chinese economy (and the world economy with it) is still in significant trouble.

China today is much different than China during the SARS outbreak in 2003, [here are some graphs that show just how different](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/05/coronavirus-how-china-economy-has-changed-since-sars.html). Notice how China was a much smaller share of the world economy back then (just above 4% according to this graph) compared to 16% now. Services and consumption make up a much larger part of the Chinese economy now, going from a little over 40% back then to around 52% now. According to [this](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Caixin/Coronavirus-costs-China-service-sector-144bn-in-1-week) source, that service industry was hit with a $144b loss in a week from coronavirus. SARS was estimated to do [$33 billion in damage to the world economy](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health/u-s-and-others-tighten-curbs-on-travel-to-china-virus-toll-hits-213-idUSKBN1ZT374), coronavirus did an estimated 330% more damage (not adjusted for inflation) just to the Chinese service industry (and I think that is an underestimate) in one week. China also accounts for over 12% of global exports now as opposed to a little over 6% back in 2003. China also accounts for [one-third of global GDP growth](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2018/07/25/na072618-chinas-economic-outlook-in-six-charts).

Chinese tourism has boomed since 2003 too. Tourism to Hong Kong has dropped off sharply thanks to the protests as well as coronavirus, [going from 200,000 visitors per day in February 2019 to less than 3,000 now](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EQ358ruWsAA8AZb?format=jpg&name=medium). Most flights to/from America (and other countries) are cancelled through the end of [March or April](https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/02/14/world/14reuters-china-health-airlines-factbox.html). SARS hit a manufacturing based economy growing at a 12% rate and that was only 4% of the world economy. This is a service based economy growing at 6% (if you believe the real numbers) that is 16% of the world economy. You can't make up the tourism or services revenue like you can with manufacturing. 750m people [according to the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/15/business/china-coronavirus-lockdown.amp.html#click=https://t.co/ZuO31QVi6g) are currently under some form of lockdown. Even if these quarantines lift soon (that‚Äôs a major question), the massive tourism industry both to and from China has taken a huge hit for the near future that cannot be recovered.

In December 2019, a Moody‚Äôs analyst called Chinese corporate debt the [biggest threat to the global economy](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/17/chinas-corporate-debt-is-biggest-threat-to-global-economy-moodys.html). [4.9% of China‚Äôs private issuers defaulted on loans in 2019](https://www.reuters.com/article/china-markets-default/chinas-private-firms-face-record-default-risk-to-stay-high-in-2020-fitch-idUKL4N28K1YM). This number is up from 0.6% in 2014. Banks have been [encouraged](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-gdp-breakingviews/breakingviews-chinas-shadow-bankers-sneak-back-to-market-idUSKBN1ZG0D5) to give loans to tiny, risky businesses while also trying to get bad debt off their books. Due to problems with their banking system, China nationalized its first bank in [20 years](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-27/china-s-first-bank-seizure-in-20-years-spooks-lenders-investors) last year. Then they proceeded to take over [two more](https://www.theepochtimes.com/beijing-nationalizes-third-bank-in-3-months_3036953.html). This over-leveraged banking system had been showing its cracks before coronavirus made China grind to a halt for a month. Questions have been raised as to whether or not the industry can be leaned on for an economic recovery as hard as the Chinese government is leaning on it now.

This was an economy [in trouble](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/16/business/economy/china-economy-gdp.html) before the coronavirus hit. The [shadow banking system](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-08/trouble-is-brewing-in-the-darkest-corner-of-china-shadow-banking) appears to have gotten out of control. [Shadow banking accounted for 39% and 45% of total lending in Q1 and Q2 2019](https://www.ft.com/content/4c66b622-dea5-11e9-9743-db5a370481bc). According to Bloomberg, wealth managers have been offering ‚Äúhigh yield products‚Äù to investors and have been using their own capital to make these returns whole due to that high default rate mentioned in the last paragraph. The Bloomberg article states that, ‚Äúbecause the products are opaque and regulation is minimal, nobody knows exactly how much money is at risk.‚Äù This article is from October 2019, before coronavirus became a concern.

This is not an economy poised to bounce back like it did with SARS in 2003, despite what the market thinks. It might take a while for the market to realize it, but all it takes is a look at the data to see why that assertion is false. The market is focused on the fact that the virus won't kill us all and not on the fact that the lost revenue from Chinese consumption cannot be made up, despite the CCP propaganda that is being put out from Chinese government officials and Chinese economists. [An article from Barron‚Äôs](https://www.barrons.com/articles/coronavirus-brings-chinas-debt-problem-back-into-light-51581679800?mod=hp_LEAD_1) has this to say:

>One area, in particular, is back at the forefront‚Äîlocal debt. Policy makers have directed regional lenders to tolerate a higher threshold for bad loans, hoping to keep thousands of small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) from collapsing amid the economic standstill. A survey conducted recently by Peking and Tsinghua universities‚ÄîChina‚Äôs top two schools‚Äîfound that two-thirds of such firms said they could stay afloat no more than one to two months with their current savings. An additional 18% said they could last at most three months.

>Put another way, 85% of China‚Äôs SMEs would crumble within three months without financial injections of some sort.

[Here](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/featured%20insights/china/china%20and%20the%20world%20inside%20the%20dynamics%20of%20a%20changing%20relationship/mgi-china-and-the-world-full-report-vf.ashx) is a report from McKinsey from July 2019 that has a lot of good data in it regarding China‚Äôs exposure to the world economy. I‚Äôm just going to post some direct quotes and charts from the report and let you decide what they mean:

>In 11 of the 16 quarters since 2015, consumption contributed more than 60 percent of [China‚Äôs] total GDP growth.

>In the United States, among the firms listed in the MSCI USA index, revenue exposure to China amounted to 15 percent of the IT sector, 7 percent of materials, and 6 percent of industrials. In 2017, US companies were estimated to have generated around $450 billion to $500 billion revenue in China through a mix of exports and revenue from Chinese subsidiaries.

[Here](https://i.imgur.com/tebHQRv.png) is a chart from the report showing how exposed the world is to China. Luckily for us, as shown in the above report, US exposure to China is not as massive as you might think. The exposure comes mostly from the rest of Asia, Australia, and Africa instead of developed markets. However, the amount of exposure from developed countries is not negligible. The technology sector, which has driven the majority of our stock market growth, has a [disproportionate exposure](https://i.imgur.com/UeBdEB0.jpg) to revenue coming from China, especially semiconductors like Intel, Micron, Nvidia, and AMD. That chart uses data from 2017 so I would almost guarantee it is less now, but still concerning.

While 4 of the 5 mega caps that make up [almost 20% of the S&P 500‚Äôs value](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4323952-s-and-p-500-five-great-tech-titans-of-america) and have generated [1/5 of S&P 500 returns since 2009](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-15/all-the-ways-stock-market-bulls-have-gone-off-the-rails-again) don‚Äôt have much, if any, China exposure on a surface level. However, Apple derived [16.7% of their revenue](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/27/apple-impact-of-coronavirus-on-china-business.html) from China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong in 2019. Not to mention that Foxconn factories are still mostly closed down over there and not producing anything. Additionally, [20% of Amazon‚Äôs COGS for private label brands is attributable to China](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/how-much-amazon-wayfair-will-have-to-boost-prices-tariffs-2019-9-1028499095). Due to how prevalent indexing is, I believe that a tech selloff lead by semiconductors and Apple (just like the old trade war selloffs) would drag down all megacap tech stocks and present a good entry point for an eventual recovery.

All of this comes on top of Boeing‚Äôs struggles with the 737 Max, which are expected to cut US GDP growth by [20%](https://www.axios.com/boeing-production-freeze-gdp-impact-737-max-d2b3b7c9-9a3b-4a2a-a3a0-a49fb54156d0.html) in 2020. In 2017 and 2018, China accounted for [22%](https://www.barrons.com/articles/boeing-plane-deliveries-china-737-max-crash-comac-airbus-trade-deal-51579101765) of Boeing plane deliveries. In 2019, that number dropped to 12%. These struggles with China‚Äôs economy and the self inflicted 737 Max struggles will put even more downward pressure on US GDP growth for this year. The phase one trade deal was expected to help Boeing out, but there are now [questions](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/02/14/china-united-states-trade-deal-commitments-coronavirus-trump-energy-huawei/) as to whether or not China will hold up to their end of it. 

In addition to these Chinese economic struggles, other Asian countries are showing economic woes as well. Singapore just cut their 2020 GDP forecast from 0.5%-2.5% to -0.5%-1.5%. Japan released their Q4 2019 GDP numbers, showing its largest GDP decline since 2014, an annualized rate of [-6.3%](https://www.cmcmarkets.com/en/news-and-analysis/singapore-cuts-2020-growth-forecast-japan-gdp-slumps), coming in way lower than analyst expectations of -2.6%. This was before the coronavirus started sweeping Asia, the Q1 GDP numbers could be worse. While China is responsible for 12.6% of our trade, Japan accounts for 5.4%. A Japanese recession will hurt us too.

To summarize and give some of my personal opinions to go along with this data, I believe the Chinese economy is in a lot more trouble than most people realize. The shadow banking system is massive and their banks are incredibly over leveraged. There are questions as to whether or not banks can perform the economic stimulus that China is demanding from them to keep small and medium sized firms open. I believe that the data shows China is in very dangerous economic territory that could lead to a recession or at least a major drop in growth for at least Q1 and Q2 2020 that cannot be made up in the second half of the year. It appears to me that these China economic troubles will take a lot of Asia and other developing economies down with them. It remains to be seen if it will take the American economy down too, but I believe that semiconductors and Apple should be trading lower than their current valuations to reflect potential lost growth and revenue streams. I also see Boeing‚Äôs struggles continuing to weigh on our GDP growth. I believe the market is fundamentally mispricing risk in the technology sector right now and it will overcorrect downwards in the near future.

TL;DR: China‚Äôs economy is potentially going down led by an over-leveraged banking system and it may cause our tech stocks, which derive supply and demand from China, to lead a market correction. Comparing this coronavirus situation to SARS is extremely disingenuous due to the state of the Chinese economy in 2003 compared to the state of the Chinese economy now. The downward pressures from China on world GDP growth as well as Boeing‚Äôs pressures on our own GDP growth create a significant risk in all world equity markets that is not being priced in. I‚Äôm not saying we‚Äôre definitely heading towards a US recession or even a global recession, but the risk should not be ignored by world markets, no matter how much liquidity central banks pump in.

The Shadow War: How Thursday and Friday Set Up for Another Engineered Circuitbreaker Next Monday 3/16/20,fit5yg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fit5yg/the_shadow_war_how_thursday_and_friday_set_up_for/,"**Are our markets under a coordinated financial attack?** We thought MM were tinkering with things behind the scene, but there is an actor with tons of capital squeezing our MM in the USA, draining liquidity as MM face increased losses and are unable to provide transactions for people trying to hedge in these financial markets, and bringing about these engineered drops in the stock market. The timing of this is not coincidental given that we are currently engaging the coronavirus amidst the backdrop of an election year and instability with the oil pricing war. I've created this thread with /u/bemusedfyz after hashing out these thoughts.

**Part I. Firms/Hedge Funds are Net Short Gamma Resulting in MM Buying Calls to Provide Liquidity**

In a bull market, firms purchase calls to be long gamma. MM try to capture rebates by taking on the opposite positions since they do not physically own the security.

**""This means that whenever a market-maker fills an investor's buy order, the MM is facilitating the trade by shorting shares. \[1\]""**

They have to go short in order to sell a security they do not own (this is why they are exempted from short selling). In the other case, during a downturn, firms want to hedge using puts and become short gamma, thus MM must take on calls. As people previously noted in my posts, if there is a buyer of an option, there has to be a MM selling the option to provide the liquidity. How then do MM make profit? They make profit from rebates by providing tighter spreads compared to other MM. By narrowing the bid/ask spread, MM keep the rebate, creating very thin margins. Thus, volume and liquidity are key to profits for MM.

**Part II. How Options Inform Price Action by Identifying the Real Money Flows**

People have been asking ""how do you know which options for SPX/SPY being purchased are purchased by actual firms for a position?"" I've been using 3 key metrics to inform me of the direction of intraday trading, and I will explain them more in another thread:

1. Strike/Expiration
2. Block Size
3. Correlation with volatility, gold, and treasuries

Options data within the last 10 minutes of close has been particularly informative of the direction of the following price action. During the close on Tuesday, volume was strong on the buy side as we bounced from the June 2019 low, and we broke back into the 285 channel which was previously strong support indicating a bullish signal (Figure 1).

[Figure 1: 3\/10\/20 and 3\/11\/20 SPY Chart](https://preview.redd.it/npzk20opjqm41.png?width=2130&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab92a2d280fab8b65b0538984f12604c18186308)

If someone was purchasing large amounts of puts (this was not just Tuesday, but last Friday and Monday as well), then MM were hugely positioned unfavorably with calls on the opposite end of the trade. Immediately after trading, we had a huge fade immediately after close. **There has been strange price action where TLT fades, which indicates more liquidity being brought into the indices along with the short cover rally**. **However, right after the close, we immediately fade hard and futures dump.** MM therefore need to hedge by trading futures, or by delta hedging and selling shares at the open with a significant loss, magnifying selling dips. This is similar to how autists discovered during a rally, MM delta hedge by purchasing the underlying equity contributing to the rally.

Delta hedging refers to either having an opposing option with equal magnitude of delta, for instance a straddle, or by purchasing shares of the underlying stock. One key disadvantage with delta hedging is that MM can over hedge if the spot price of the equity changes unexpectedly overnight. This is referred to as **gap risk**, and compounds with **the inventory MM hold** overnight, often referred to as **inventory risk**.\[2-3\] The overnight moves create huge gamma and vega swings to the inventory of MM who hold overnight, which subsequently create a period of selling or buying which magnifies the intraday swings as they try to reduce their vega or gamma exposure.

>... is subject to residual risks due to stochastic volatility and unhedgeable overnight moves in the stock price. These risks highlight the need to keep the Vega and Gamma of the dealer‚Äôs inventory under control, and this is reflected in the dealer‚Äôs quoting strategy.\[4\]

Given that we dumped on Wednesday and dropped below 285 support, institutions need to hedge with more puts given the uncertainty about retesting the June 2019 low. More puts purchased by funds, more calls purchased by MM. What happened Thursday and Friday (Figure 2)?

[Figure 2: 3\/12\/20 and 3\/13\/20 SPY Chart](https://preview.redd.it/wrgfx8w0kqm41.png?width=2130&format=png&auto=webp&s=780e573d407e05b4b7cd721ded33273c0fbcb0da)

Futures limit down on 3/12/20. No matter what, the market opens -5%. Within 5 minutes at the open, the market hits the second circuit breaker at -7%. MM are stuck with short term calls, and need to offload losses by selling like crazy to delta hedge magnifying losses. Then what happens on Friday 3/13/20? Limit up. We next quickly hit one of the largest intraday rallies of all time.

**Part III. MM Cannot Access Repo Despite Requiring Liquidity**

During trading on Thursday, the Fed announced an unprecedented amount of Repo operations. 1.15 trillion dollars, signifying significant issues in the market. I stated this before open on Friday.

>8 am - Yesterday, the fed offered more than 500 billion in repo. Only 78.4 billion was taken. Today, the Fed just offered more than 1.1 trillion in repo for today. What are the signals? Why is Wall Street not taking the money for liquidity? Check this out: [https://www.biancoresearch.com/the-moment-in-this-decline-has-arrived-2/](https://www.biancoresearch.com/the-moment-in-this-decline-has-arrived-2/)  
>  
>This could possibly be way worse than 2008.  
>  
>8:30 - 24.1 billion in repo taken. Last update will be 9am.  
>  
>9:00 - 45.1 billion.  
>  
>Net repo: 86.5 billion out of 1.15 trillion

**""Dealers are telling me they badly want the $1T in repos, but can't take it.  Post-crisis rules, among so many different regulators (Basel 3, Fed, OCC, FDIC, etc) make it nearly impossible for them to take the money.  They are telling the Fed their problems.  The Fed had no clue.""**

[https://twitter.com/biancoresearch/status/1238461580314120193](https://twitter.com/biancoresearch/status/1238461580314120193)

During Thursday's trading, we broke the support. Due to breaking previous supports and being oversold, I had puts. But also noticed huge call volume. If someone is buying calls, MM need to be net ""short."" Futures limit up. MM need to quickly buy the rally in order to delta hedge, creating an epic rally for the past decade.

**Part IV. The End Game**

Someone is taking advantage of the MM delta hedging by limiting down or up futures, vastly opposite of the price action more often than not without regard to support or resistance levels. MM are left bagholding their positions and delta hedging, magnifying the rallies or dips.

Repos are not being adequately uptaken due to existing regulations. What happens when liquidity issues arise despite decreasing volatility? MM need to enlarge the spread in order to further manage losses.

IV was going down on Friday during the rally, as VIX began dropping. The only way for the option value to decrease is if MM started enlarging the spread, in order to capture diminishing rebates. The only way the bid value is increasing is if a MM is facing liquidity issues, since they cut into the rebate. What happens when these firms become stressed and unable to provide liquidity? Firms will be unable to purchase options with good bids or at all. If people are not able to hedge or use financial derivatives, losses will accumulate such that there will be a mass liquidation event such that it is no longer tenable to hold any positions.

What happened immediately after close Friday?

Throughout the day there was massive amounts of put buying. Immediately close to the cash close, more puts were purchased. At the cash close, we fade hard. Immediately after, /ES gaps down more than 2% after the close on Friday. /CL gaps down more than 3%.

The news during the weekend last week for the oil price was dropped during Sunday before markets opened, causing a limit down last week. **Energy is the market**. Saudi Arabia is a strategic partner with the US in the Middle East, and asking Russia to aid in production cuts to raise the price of oil. However, Russia refused. Saudi Arabia is not taking these measures to attack US energy markets by increasing production. Despite this, is Russia interested harming US interests? Perhaps. It's possible to think there is another player. And they know that US markets cannot access repo money and are short in liquidity, creating a unique attack vector, straight at the heart of the US financial system.

[https://news.bloomberglaw.com/securities-law/mnuchin-says-hes-seeking-to-keep-financial-markets-open](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/securities-law/mnuchin-says-hes-seeking-to-keep-financial-markets-open)

**‚ÄúWe intend to keep the markets open -- that‚Äôs a sign of confidence for people,‚Äù Mnuchin said in a CNBC interview early Friday.**

It is not only MM that require repo money. Banks lend out their credit lines to others. It is these businesses that are lent the money that will be the hardest. Given these market conditions, and if they persist, the government needs to intervene and shut down markets.

We are already facing close to limit down on the Weekend Dow on Saturday. Sunday Futures are likely to limit down. **This will probably be compounded by either worse impending virus news or more bad news in the energy markets.** To combat this, Trump has stated the US intends to significantly add to the US strategic oil reserve to put a floor on the price of oil. However, these are being used as a cover to justify lower prices, when in fact, the markets are being engaged possibly by economic subterfuge to reduce liquidity. Someone is purchasing huge options positions before close with MM take the other side of the trade. Futures limit up/down, creating large gap/inventory risk, reducing liquidity for the markets.

**tl;dr Banks and MM are facing forced liquidity issues by someone taking advantage of limit up/down, exploiting gap and inventory risk. Banks and MM cannot take on repo due to regulations to correct liquidity issues. Funds and trading desks need MM to purchase puts/calls. Cannot purchase them due to MM having liquidity issues with worsening bid price, magnifying rallies or drops as MM delta hedge. If firms cannot stop losses without hedges, they will liquidate everything. This will create a mass panic sell off, which will therefore require the government to shut down the market.**

**tl;dr of the tl;dr Circuit breaker Monday. Possibly two.**

Update 1: /u/Sushies, /u/satorikang both explained the positioning is probably long gamma on the puts, not short at this stage. Thanks.

Update 2 3/15/20: I'm writing this example if a firm is taking a collar position in terms of options.

"When Market Bounce Inevitably Comes...Don't Scream ""GUH"" and Avoid IV Crush (DD Inside)",fmshcv,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fmshcv/when_market_bounce_inevitably_comesdont_scream/,"WSB's greatest advantage is that we pretty much exclusively trade options. That great asset is also our greatest enemy because I would bet 90% of you autists don't understand how they work, so I am here today to try and help you out.

With such insane spikes in volatility (i.e. rises in IV on the option contracts), it is very easy to get fucked by ""IV crush."" For those idiots who do not know what this means: IV Crush is when volatility (a key component of the option premium) decreases, causing your option contract to lose value, even if you called the directional move correctly. This happened on Thursday and Friday to many autists, including myself, due to the lower than usual volatility. Now, this volatility can translate to your advantage. If you were long puts at the start of the Rona Bear Market, you would have made massive tendies because you called **the direction and the increase in volatility.**

As with any market route, there is always a bounce, bull trap, dead cat bounce - whatever the fuck you want to call it. The fact is, we are incredibly oversold, and the markets will experience a partial recovery eventually. What I am showing you is that if you buy calls and the market slightly recovers you called **the direction but will experience a decrease in volatility.** This limits your output of tendies.

I will use u/Variation-Separate and his call for a short term bottoming around 213 on the $SPY and take his rally to the 270 range. The obvious play if what he says happens is picking up 4/17 220c/230c/240c/250c/260c (whatever your preference) and riding the increase. The issue with this play is that your upside is going to be limited by IV crush. 

Volatility is measured most transparently for the $SPY using the $VIX, which has been pushing records during this market route. Using historical data, I took a look at the market volatility in 2018, 2017, 2016, and 2008 to show you that on relief rallies, after a significant pullback,the $VIX (aka the proxy for implied volatility on $SPY options) drastically decreases during market recoveries. **What this means: your long calls that you scooped up when $SPY was at 213 will not print as much because while $SPY may hit 270 and you will make some money, you are going to get IV crushed by the fall in volatility.**

**The important takeaway:** on dead cat bounces / bull traps / market rallies, the $VIX significantly pulls back. Put another way, the IV on your $SPY calls decreases when markets rebound.

**So how do I avoid getting IV crushed on the market rally?**

Hedge vega (the quantifiable proxy for IV on option pricing). Vega represents the change in an option value for a 1% change in IV. 

The hedge is by going long $SPY calls, and hedging the vega by shorting the $VIX with puts. All you need to do is match up the vega of the $SPY call with the delta of the $VIX put.

**The Hypothetical Trade:**

Long $SPY 4/17 240c - trading at 9.65 a piece with a **vega** of 0.2404

Long $VIX 4/15 52.5p - trading at 7.90 a piece with a **delta** of -0.2463

This essentially creates a vega-neutral position, aka Fuck Off IV Crush You Dumb Cuck. All you need to do is match up the vega of the $SPY call with the delta of the $VIX put, and you will be able to print massive tendies if you call the directional movement correct. However, since option greeks are constantly changing it is best to do this in a shorter time frame, so be nimble.

It should be noted this can be done using spreads or futures but that is üåà People keep bringing up IV on the $VIX, which does exist, and can be visualized with $VVIX. If you want a perfect hedge explore vol futures, otherwise you will face some IV crush on $VIX puts, but the hedge still holds up quite well. 

**tl;dr -** When the market bounces and you go long $SPY calls, avoid IV crush by buying puts on the $VIX. Just match up the $SPY call vega with the $VIX put delta. 

Enjoy the quarantine - üåàüê∂

Edit:

A lot are asking so it should be noted: if you were betting that $SPY would go down with puts, hedging IV is silly because drops in the $SPY almost always correlate to a higher $VIX, so you most likely won‚Äôt get IV crushed. However, if you still wanted to be Vega-neutral with $SPY puts, you would still use $VIX puts because Vega is a positive greek and you are still trying to hedge away a decrease in IV. Note: $SPY falling in marginal, incremental amounts can still experience decreasing IV, so hedging Vega on puts is not always a bad idea in a high IV environment.

Not financial advise, just for educational purposes. The use of specific expiries was to model the Vega / Delta relationship between VIX and SPY",1584873963.0,1314,bigd0g111,1,wsb,1

"Goodbye friends, it's been a long ride",cdx5yw,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cdx5yw/goodbye_friends_its_been_a_long_ride/,"In the past two maybe three years I got hooked on options trading (aka gambling). I ran up on AMD options back when it was $13-14 from $300 to $15K. Thought I was a god at trading and could just run it up to the millions. Clearly that's not what happened. I quickly lost all of it all and put more money in. To this date I probably lost around $25k maybe a little more (don't want to actually check and get depressed and kill myself :')). But finally I'm going to call it quits, I wasted the whole year's pay which for a 24 year old student is not much ($19k maybe), stuck in credit card debt and finally with some bad car troubles definitely need to stop gambling. It's been really fun reading posts on here and constantly checking stocks but I've deleted it all and just need to get fresh air. It's been fun guys, thanks for the ride. Others who are in the same boat, honestly, we have a gambling problem and just need to stop. We might hit it big but in the end if we keep going all the money disappears. Thankfully my debt is only about 3-4k which is a lot but manageable in probably a couple months of working and living frugally. Thanks guys.

The Big Long - Made $2.5 million in January off $100k options investment,80e7x2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/80e7x2/the_big_long_made_25_million_in_january_off_100k/,"TLDR: [Author](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/17286980.Steve_Oliverez)/Investor, bought ~$100,000 of SPX calls late November through December betting the whole market would go up fast in Q1. It did, and I was able to sell a bunch before February came and wiped out the value of the remaining options (*As I've said before, options trading is extremely risky and buying out-of-the-money options even more so). [Total profit, ~$2,500,000](https://ibb.co/gk0bax).

Many of you know I was posting about $100k in SPX calls back in December and then January when the value started taking off. Figured I owed you an update.

Why I bought a crazy amount of SPX calls:
Congress passed a bill slashing corporate tax rates in December. The last time corporate taxes were reduced so much was back in 1986. So I looked at how the market reacted at the beginning of 1987 and saw a huge spike in the S&P 500 in the first quarter.

I wanted to bet the market would react in a similar fashion. I looked through various strike prices in Jan-Mar and modeled which ones would have the highest payouts if Jan 2018 was a repeat of Jan 1987. I also ran a few more conservative scenarios and bought options at those inflection points as well. Many of these options were so far out of the money at the time they were selling for under a dollar. With volatility so low a melt up wasn‚Äôt being priced in at all so I put in every dollar I was comfortable losing.

January turned out to be the best first month of the year for the market in more than two decades. The value of the options skyrocketed, some by as much as 5000%. 

I was excited and terrified for the same reasons I bought options and not futures or heavily margined shares in the first place. Going back to 1987, there was eventually a large crash (Black Monday) that wiped out most of the gains for that year. I also knew we were currently going through one of the largest stretches of market history without a substantial pullback. I was pretty sure the market was going to go up and fast, but it was like a game of hot potato to lock in gains before a major correction happened. 

With that in mind I actively sold off chunks of the investment as it went up in January. Since I didn‚Äôt know if or when a correction would happen, I wanted to make sure I locked in as much profit as possible.

I was still holding the bag on a bunch of these options when Feb came and wiped them out, taking a large amount of paper gains with them. Another green week and I definitely would have been into yacht-money territory with this trade.

Still, I‚Äôd managed to sell enough in January to lock in two and a half million dollars from a $100k investment.

Aside from NVDA leaps I picked up last year and stocks I plan on holding indefinitely, I'm currently mostly in cash waiting to figure out the next move.",1519691081.0,342,stevebmmm,1,wsb,1

When asked to clarify his statement on the markets as we asked, the president responded with: 

""They're killing lots of people some of which are very bad to the economy very bad if you ask me. A lot of people agree with me believe me you see. By getting rid of the bad people in the economy the economy goes up very high we have a great economy don't we?

Stocks only go up,fwrlox,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fwrlox/stocks_only_go_up/,"
*This economic data looks grim,* I think to myself. *This is the right move.* I look to the cracked screen of my iPhone 5s. A single 6/19 SPY 200p. I take a deep breath, and swipe up to submit the order. As RobinHood's little animation shows the order completing, I suddenly black out.

I come to in a gray room, fluorescent lights humming above. I'm upright in a metal chair, restrained, with my arms and legs zip-tied. The only feature in the room is what I assume to be a Bloomberg Terminal in front of me (I've never seen one in real life). There's so many screens. It looks so professional. A dizzying array of charts, numbers and symbols light up its dozen monitors. In the center, the S&P 500. 2700. Out of its bear market.

I hear several sets of heavy footsteps approaching behind me. I try to look, but can't move much. I sense several burly men standing over my shoulders. To my surprise, Jerome Powell steps in front of me. I try to speak up but he cuts me off. ""What am I-"" 

""Why did you short the domestic market?"" he asks.

""Huh?"" I respond, confused.

""Why did you short the domestic market?"" he demands, louder this time.

""I, uh... the coronavirus is a global pandemic. It's going to cause-"" **WHAM!** One of the thugs behind me slams my head with something heavy. It's a bundle of $100 bills. They're still warm from the printing press, and the fresh smell of ink fills my nose. It must be a million or more.

""It's priced in,"" he says coolly. ""So why did you short the domestic market?""

Dizzy from the blow, I notice the screen behind the Chairman. The S&P has climbed back to 2850. *Impossible*, I think to myself. ""Be-be-because unemployment is approaching 20 percent!"" I manage to answer. **WHAM!** Another blow strikes me. This time, a heavy bag filled with paper. It explodes on impact, raining bond certificates like confetti all over the small room. I catch a glimpse of some as they float to the ground. Investment grade bonds from Ford. Loans to cruise ship companies. Loans to a taco truck.

""Repeat after me: stocks only go up,"" Powell demands.

I say nothing. On the terminal behind him, the S&P has climbed well over 3000. An involuntary *guh* escapes my mouth as it falls agape.

Powell frowns and continues, ""I'll ask you one more time: why did you short the domestic market?""

I feel like I'm going to pass out again, but with all the strength I can muster I shout, ""GDP declines are going to dwarf the Great Depression! The outbreak is far from over! Stimulating demand won't work if there's no supply! Social unrest is a real possibility! We're in uncharted ter-"" the hardest slam yet hits the back of my skull. It's a massive stack of printer paper. It falls to the floor with a thud. Some sort of Excel spreadsheet is on it. It's the Fed's balance sheet. It must be tens of thousands of pages long. I can't even count how many digits are in their asset balance.

""Stocks only go up,"" Powell repeats. Behind him, the chart shows the S&P has continued its rise at a blistering pace. It leaves 3300 in the dust, making new all time highs.

The first two blows to my head left me feeling woozy. The third one, though, brought sudden clarity. Tears well up in my eyes, but they are not tears of sadness as my puts become worthless - oh no. They are tears of joy. Suddenly, I see it. Suddenly, the truth rings out as clearly as if a chorus of angels has descended from Heaven to sing it into my ears. How could I have been so wrong all these years? In this moment, I am enlightened. The pieces fall into place.

#Background
There are only 4 Greeks that you really need to know to trade equity options:

1.	Delta
2.	Gamma
3.	Theta
4.	Vega

If you have at least a modest understanding of these, you‚Äôll be on your way to sweet, sweet tendies in no time. Now onto the gREEEE^EEEEEE^EEks


---


##Delta

Delta is the grand-daddy of them all. The Hugh Heffner of the Greeks. Most of you probably are familiar with delta, because it‚Äôs the easiest one. Easier than your sister, which is really saying something.
**Delta represents the relative increase in the price of an option, given an increase in the price of the underlying.** When you buy or sell an option, the price change doesn‚Äôt exactly mirror the stock 1:1. Options expire at some point in the future. Stocks don‚Äôt expire.

The implication here is that an option is only valuable if you can exercise it for a profit. Logically, this means that deep ITM options will have a delta pretty close to +/-1 (depending on whether it‚Äôs a call or a put), while deep OTM options will have a delta pretty close to 0 (or 100/0, whatever convention you use, the only difference is where the decimal is). **Note:** Option deltas range from -1 to 1 (or -100 to 100 deltas). Calls have positive delta (0 to 1) while Puts have negative delta (-1 to 0).

If you‚Äôre seeing deltas on your trading platform that are not in this range, you‚Äôre probably seeing Dollar Delta, which is just:

Delta x Notional Shares (usually 100 per lot) x Price of Underlying

**Autist‚Äôs interpretation:** The easiest way to wrap your autistic brains around this is to think of delta as *roughly* the probability of the underlying stock price going beyond your strike at expiration. For example, an ATM call has around 50 deltas. That means you can intuitively view it as having a 50/50 chance of expiring in the money. An increase in the stock price would give you even greater chances, hence the delta of a slightly ITM call is a little over 50, and deep ITM calls are close to 100 deltas. An ATM Put has roughly -50 deltas. This doesn‚Äôt mean a -50% chance of expiring ITM you fucking idiot, it just means that your option value is negatively correlated to price increases.


---



##Gamma

Gamma is the least-hyped Greek out of all of them, but definitely one that could cause your portfolio to turn into a shitshow while you‚Äôre not paying attention. **Gamma represents the change in Delta, given a change in the underlying price.**

Gamma is the 2nd order mathematical derivative of price. It tells you how fast your delta will change when price moves happen. Just like speed and acceleration. The second one tells you the rate of change of the first. It can also be interpreted as a measure of convexity, telling you how flat or round something is. Like your flat-chested girlfriend has almost no titty gamma, while Kate Upton titties got gamma for days. Gamma is always positive, and is always largest ATM.

**Autist‚Äôs interpretation:** Think of gamma as the big swing when options go from being OTM to ITM or vice versa. So the next time you see that piece of shit stock hitting all time highs, think to yourself ‚ÄúHoly shit, this dumpster fire might actually moon, better YOLO on some calls real quick‚Äù, then it drops by $0.05 and your calls drop 50%, blame it on the gamma.


---



##Theta

Theta is the turtle of the greeks. Doesn‚Äôt move too fast, doesn‚Äôt do too much when you poke it with a stick, boring as fuck. But this is where the time value of options comes from, so it‚Äôs important that you know what it is. **Theta is the change in option price, given a 1 day change in time**.

Short option positions have positive theta. Long options positions have negative theta. This means that the marketable value of the  option decays each day it comes closer to the expiration date. Less time to expiry = less time to moon, which means people will pay less for it. This is essentially how options selling strategies make their profits. They bet that the price won‚Äôt move that much, and most of the time, they‚Äôre actually right, because dumb cucks like you are willing to pay those prices.

Like gamma, theta is also the largest when an option is ATM. As time passes, theta becomes larger and larger. The implication here being that the last week of an option‚Äôs life, theta will be exponentially larger.

**Autist‚Äôs interpretation:** Think of theta as the shot clock. It keeps ticking away, no matter if the game is exciting or boring. If it‚Äôs a really close game (i.e. the option is ATM), then the shot clock is pretty much the make or break thing for you. If the game is a blowout (option is OTM) then it doesn‚Äôt really matter that much. When it comes down to the final minute, and it‚Äôs make-it-or-break-it for your shitty, shitty, poorly thought out March Madness bracket selections, you‚Äôre literally ripping your hair out because you‚Äôre on the emotions express, screaming ‚ÄúWHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT, REF? ARE YOU FUCKING BLIND?‚Äù and then cry and piss yourself in the corner. That‚Äôs the only time theta really matters.

##Vega

Possibly one of the most misunderstood Greeks, and 105% of the reason behind why RH faggots try to get their trades reversed. **Vega is the change in price of an option for a 1pt increase in the implied volatility of the underlying**.

Now, some of you faggots may know what implied volatility (IV) is, others think you do. No one actually does, because it‚Äôs a fucking made up concept in order to get the math to work. The short bus explanation is that implied volatility tells you how much people buying and selling options think that the underlying price has the potential to move in either direction before expiration.

I‚Äôm not going to go into how it‚Äôs backed out of the Black-Scholes pricing model, or how implied volatility actually represents an estimated annualized 1 standard deviation (68.27%) interval assuming a gaussian distribution of continuous time price movements (specifically addressed to all of you elitist NERDS out there, cash me in the comments, howbow dah?).

Implied volatility is the only unobservable and incalculable input to an option‚Äôs price. It‚Äôs literally made up. Historically, it hangs out somewhere between 5-10% above historical realized volatility, but when or why it jumps or drops is purely based on the dumb cucks who are trading the options.

The important distinction here is that **Implied Volatility tells you whether an option is relatively expensive or relatively cheap. Vega does not.** Vega just tells you how sensitive an option‚Äôs price is to changes in the will of the people.

Both calls and puts have positive vega. Intuitively, this means that when people think the market will move sharply in either direction, options increase in value, because people want protection (or phat gainz).

**Autist‚Äôs interpretation:** Vega tells you how much you‚Äôre fucked when people lose interest in a hot meme stock after it doesn‚Äôt moon, or when people unwad their fucking panties after some good ‚Äòol Thursday action.

He took a long sip of the warm milk in his coffee mug. ""How much more should we print?!?"" he yelled at the intern situated at a desk outside of his office.

""I don't know man, it's unlimited, just make up a number"" the intern shouted back. JPow hated the intern's dismissive tone but the young man was 6'5'' and built like a NFL linebacker... his wife called the intern a ""Chad"", but JPow didn't know what that meant. He mumbled to himself, ""I'm the money man. Nobody else.""

JPow opened up the Google sheets doc titled ""$$$ Money for government $$$"" and looked at the only cell on the sheet with anything in it. ""100 trillion"" it read.

To be honest, I'm impressed you've gotten this far. That's a lot of words in the title. I've noticed an unprecedented influx of idiocy into this sub lately, but also a lot of quality explainers, so I wanted to add my two cents. TL;DR - this is a post about credit agreement and bond covenants and their impact on equity pricing (and how **you** \- yes, you in the back with the helmet on) - can use them to your advantage. How the fuck do I know about this? Well, I write 'em for a living. Interested? Read on. Want a ticker? Get fucked. I get charged out at $1500 an hour to explain this shit to CFOs and hedge fund managers, so be grateful I'm here to explain it to you *gratis*. Don't worry, we're going to do a practical example at the end - you can do what you want with that information.

Ever wonder where money comes from? Hurr hurr printer goes brr, I know. But where **companies** get their money from?  Well, there are four main sources of cashflow. (1) Sales (2) Equity (3) Bonds (4) Debt.  OK maybe at the moment the Fed makes 5 (but not really). Let's get started.

**Fundamentals**

**(1) Sales.** This is the basic corporate calculus - make shit, sell shit, receive money from the people who buy shit. Some companies don't even have to do that (looking at you, $APRN). (**2**) **Equity.** A bit like (1), but instead of making shit to sell, you cut off pieces of your company to sell to either public or private investors (psst. these are what your options give you a right to buy and sell) So far, so simple. Easy, right? Well, we're not here to talk about that shit. This is AP debt instruments, retards. That JV shit is for r/investing and for the r/all normies. (3) and (4) are what heavy hitters care about (and where you can get something of an edge).

**(3) Bonds.** No, not the iconic Australia underwear brand your wife's boyfriend wears. This is where you issue - either privately or through a public placement - long or short term debt instruments (bonds, notes, paper, whatever - it all means the same shit) to the market. It's basically an IOU from the company. The hook is that these sell for less than they're worth (called 'par') - and also generate interest (called a 'coupon'). You sell a promise to repay someone $100m in 7 years for $99m, AND you promise to pay them a coupon on their investment. Plus, they can trade 'em. Literally can't go tits up! The [u/1R0NYMAN](https://www.reddit.com/u/1R0NYMAN/) of corporate credit instruments. Why would a company do it? No need for pesky banks - and you can do it quick and dirty for when you need money now for that new Gulfstream the CEO's been eyeing. **(4) Debt**. Where most of the real money comes from. This is where a bank and a borrower who love each other very much get together and agree to lend money for a fee on certain conditions. Sometimes it's two banks. Sometimes, for the more adventurous borrowers, they invite a whole syndicate of banks into the party for a fiscal gang-bang of epic proportion. They spread that risk around like your wife's boyfriend... well, you get the idea. You use this option if you want more money over more time with more flexibility than in a bond offering.

**The Rules**

Anyway, so (3) and (4) are in great big beefy documents hidden at the back of 10-Ks that noone other than me and hedge fund managers ever read. Spoiler alert - I am not going to explain things like the difference between a TLA, TLB and revolver to you, or talk about secured and unsecured debt.  Loads of the fucking rules in them don't matter (don't tell anyone - this is what keeps us in a job). Google it if you're interested. **However,** one section \***does**\* matter (a lot). They're called 'negative covenants'. Negative means negative. Covenant is a fancy word for 'rule'. See, the way these documents work is that they're drafted to say 'You're not allowed to do anything EXCEPT for the following'. The neg covenants are the exceptions to the rule that you're not allowed to do anything.

There are a bunch that are normal, practical rules. Can't change shit about the company **except for shit that doesn't matter**, can't sell your shit without telling the banks **except for shit that's really cheap**, can't buy stuff **except for stuff you need**, etc. The big one for our purposes is called INDEBTEDNESS. This is the rule that **you can't borrow more money, except....**. And this is where WSB can come in.

Banks are like women. They like exclusivity. They don't want to give it all up on the first date expecting you to hold them dear and true for the next 5-7 years and then see you out on the town 6 months later with some slutty direct lender. They feel... shame. And also like that there is a risk that you won't be able to pay \*them\* back. See, most of what companies actually spend money on is debt service. The interest and fees and shit stack up fast (especially when the company blows its load on some shitty acquisition straight away). So when you can borrow \*more\* money than you should be able to, your balance sheet can get ugly fast. Good money after bad, etc. - especially with companies than aren't cash-flow positive to begin with. This raises the risk of default. This can downgrade the credit rating. **This can change the stock price.**

Now, for the last 10 years, noone has really given a shit about the possibility of default because debt has been so free and easy to access. Stonks only go up, they figured, so what could go wrong? Charge a fee, sell the risk to some dicey Chinese banks who don't know any better, see ya later. But now with this Corona-shit, people feel like maybeeeee they're in a position where an already dicey lending proposition to a company without consistent cashflow and that company is about to issue some new bonds. And the syndication market is dead. So, problems. If you have big holes in your indebtedness covenants, you can utilize them to incur additional debt - which \*sometimes\* you can use for good, and sometimes you can just use to pay off your existing bad debt - kicking the can down the road. Obviously, this is bad for a company's long term health - but the CEO will be long gone by the time this matters, so who gives a shit, right?

Now you kinda need to be at a level above the average r/wallstreetbets user to wrap your head around what the docs say. They're pretty complicated. BUT, what even you can do is read a 10-K. Let's do an example together. $SIX.

**Example to work through**

$SIX is a shitty company. They're pretty highly levered. They've got lots of debt outstanding. In fact, they've got some bonds due pretty soon. Big, expensive bonds. Look at the financials. Lots of interest. Plus, they've gotta pay it back. Soon. In fact, $1 billion cash money in July 2024. Bad news for a company with no fucking cashflow for the foreseeable future. Divorced dads not taking little Janey and Johnny to Six Flags over Georgia for the annual 'Please Don't Hate Me For Leaving You' trip anytime soon. So what does SF do now? They don't want to default on that payment, or they'll go bankrupt. They look at their loan docs - remember, the baseline is \*no more debt except for the following\* - to find a way to borrow \*more\* money to pay these off. Robbing Peter to pay Paul.

If they have a freebie basket (an exception that says they can borrow money for any reason up to 'X'), then they're in luck. If they can incur 'accordion' debt, even better - this is extra debt on top of what they've already got outstanding at a similar level of seniority. This is subject to certain protections but whatever, the important thing is getting the monkey off their back. They can also combine this with, more complex baskets in a feat of linguistic gymnastics that would make Hilary Clinton blush to borrow money to pay off their other outstanding obligations. If they don't, well, that's bad.

Have a go. See if you can figure it out for yourself. Can $SIX do it? If they can, great! No bankruptcy! if they can't, well, bad times ahead - and a big short opportunity for you.

For those of you who've read this far, here's a neat trick - you don't even need to read the fucking Credit Agreement. All this shit is in the 10-K under 'Debt Obligations'. They put it all there in black and white for you to find.

**How you can do this too; the TLDR of the above**

Find a bad company. Read their 10-K. Look for bond debt expiring soon. See if they can incur debt to pay it off. If not, short the shit out of them on a 6-12 month basis. Get tendies. Repeat.

**EDIT.** I will do a follow-up later in the week if anyone has a specific question interesting enough to justify me pissing away more of my clients' money on Reddit.

**EDIT 2:** I will do a covenant analysis of the most upvoted ticker suggestion below with an explainer.

**EDIT 3:** Many of you have asked for book recommendations to learn more about my autism. I suggest *Lectures on Proust from a Soviet Prison Camp by* J√≥zef Czapski, *Under the Volcano* by Malcolm Lowry, *Moby Dick* by Herman Melville, and *Blood Meridian* by Cormac McCarthy. That shit will teach you everything you need to know about markets and life.

**EDIT 4.** $CCL is the winner. I‚Äôm going to put up the post tonight at about 8:30pm ET. Tune in tomorrow from 3pm ET for a full covenant analysis and live AMA in the comments.

**EDIT 5.** Turns out $CCL are loaded to the tits with Euro debt. As I‚Äôve explained in the comments, I‚Äôm a patriot, and accordingly I don‚Äôt fuck with European bonds or facilities. NY law ride or die. So we‚Äôre doing $SEAS instead. You‚Äôre welcome.

2/28/20 Friday. After dropping for almost an entire week straight, we reach near the 2019 October low, shorts cover heavily, and we pump back up to the 250% retracement at 293.15. All is good, just a beer virus. JPow is going to save us!

3/2/20 Monday. After making some solid gains, the Fed announced emergency cuts. We rally for 30 min. We're still staying in this uptrend channel. Seems like we made some new resistance at 285.

[SPY 5 D\/15 min + overlaid with SPY 1 Yr\/1 D, volume indicator, and RSI](https://preview.redd.it/cgrccro6gxl41.png?width=1986&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f89a65a6b63ea92c549ec4204def51a68e3f2d1)

3/6/20 Friday. All indications suggested that we were nearing the bottom of the channel at 285 to retest the lows and start forming the bottom or base. RSI was below <40 consistently, volume was slowing on the selling side. On this day, we entered extremely oversold territory.

Like clockwork, at 3:30 pm EST, shorts start covering heavily as indicated by that large number of white candles in the bottom right corner. It's going to be alright, we are going to get our YUGE rally on Monday like last time. Wait. Like last time? Like on Friday 2/28/20?

3/9/20 Monday. Futures in during the night limit down. No matter what, everyone with calls at open is absolutely screwed over. The 7% circuit breaker quickly follows 4 min in trading.

As I previously stated on 3/5/20, Sunday, when I made my first post:

>Due to this uncertainty and with additional bad news expected over the weekend, I believe we are going to still face more downside as we close near the 285, before having another large rally to the upside.

People are panicking, people are buying puts, puts, and more puts. Surely it will hit the 20% circuit breaker today, if not sometime this week? We end the day at a lower low.

>Retest of the -5% at the previous 285 was rejected. Ended lower than -7% circuit breaker and even below the August 2019 low at 273.09, creating a sign of weakness. Larger sell volume present in the final hours of trading. Most likely going to continue to the downside, but still expecting a bounce which will be used to shake out people holding their puts.

***If you haven't realized it yet, the MM already have made their third move.***

Closely after the 7% circuit breaker, MM were buying tens of thousands of SPX calls. Look at some of them and their price. What about treasury bonds at an all time high? Note that many of these were bought around 2 or 3 pm.

[3\/9\/20 Options sales on TLT](https://preview.redd.it/09jtvhfzjxl41.png?width=2788&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a2d889a81636eb6be80aef630c0cd8c858578ca)

>Another contrarian indicator given the price on Friday action. Even though we have hit -5% in /ES and passed 2850, there's actually tens of thousands of puts OTM purchased on TLT during Friday. Now that begets the question, if treasuries are the safe haven asset as more people are selling \[equities, which should drive up TLT prices\], then who is buying these puts?

3/10/20 Tuesday. Futures during the night limit up. Anyone who bought puts yesterday are screwed. Calls, autists, buy more calls! Bear r fuk!

We start plummeting to retest our new low of 270.27, stopping just short of the June 2019 low at 273.09. Bull r fuk! Suddenly, we start rallying. It's the Fed. Pump JPow, pump it harder! And just like that, we are back into our 285-315 bounded trading range.

Hang on autists. Aren't a lot of drops on Monday? I keep hearing black Monday. We got a nice rally on Tuesday. Well, we are back in our trading range, things should be okay. 285 should be our lower resistance. Lot of people watching these charts seem to agree. Has this happened before?

What's going to happen tomorrow on Wednesday? Well...

Notice the large amounts of calls early in the morning. This was right before the low at 11:30 am this Tuesday.

Now look at the insane amounts of **0DTE FD puts for March 11 tomorrow.** Just for reference, 5000 SPX FD puts for tomorrow at a premium of 22.70 is $11,350,000. There are more than >60,000 of these puts.

What about treasuries? Notice those massive amounts of puts purchased right before 11 today morning before the rally back to 285. Now notice how many calls were bought right before close today.

[3\/10\/20 TLT](https://preview.redd.it/6qoj7tzwnxl41.png?width=2784&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bc90ff9c0274baae08feaedd9370fdad9af4494)

**tl;dr Tomorrow is going to be a blood bath which has been set up for almost 2 weeks now by MM. Checkmate autists.**

**3/10/20 Update 1** \- Futures down already -1.5% at 8pm est.

I'll update more on why tomorrow was chosen. MM were already planning contingency plans or splitting up trading teams in different areas last week. Also, the college aged children of these MM most likely got notifications that universities were closing this week. People at Morgan Stanley and Barclays also have gotten sick from coronavirus. National guard deployed in NY. It hit close to home.

Just a quick edit. Every single firm has done their own internal calculation of number of cases in the USA already and how quickly it will spread. Most MM agree  the market will go down significantly more. They are taking advantage of the vol to take as much money from people as they can.

**3/11/20 Update 2 7:55 am EST** \- Think we open near 277, the August 2019. Sets us up for 273, the June 2019 low and the 269 low from Monday. This lines up with those 275/276/280 put strikes bought yesterday, locking instant gains.

I'll post my positions and plays here during my updates around 11 and 3:50 before close. If you do not have the capital to day trade, be very careful of your positionings, intraday is brutal these days. The most important setups are for the next day, and also 4/17 April puts. Don't buy the puts on a down day, wait for a bounce if you aren't in already.

Going to sell my SPY puts, TLT calls at open. Probably keep holding my VXX calls and GLD shorts. Don't have too much time to do intraday trading today.

[3\/11\/20 SPY updated chart before open.](https://preview.redd.it/150odcsci1m41.png?width=2090&format=png&auto=webp&s=869c72f7b4027c3cc5ccf6a1675d01b888c3f5d5)

Here's what's going on. 285-315 was our initial trading range. We rallied back to 285, but significantly fell below. 285 is the new resistance now. We are in between 269-285. We need to test 269 to see if that is our base.  If we fall below 269,  we are in a new trading range. And yes, I think we will go down to 269.

Selling all SPY puts, buy volume super strong. VXX going down, TLT going down.

9:50 Almost 10,000 SPX puts just purchased. Strikes between 269/280. Downtrend selling will continue. We are going to test 269 today. All 0 DTE.

11:40 More trades on puts and looks like straddles for SPX.

https://preview.redd.it/bg22aqg2d2m41.png?width=2840&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d7b1660b3d352d77836eb7b4a95f2a7f0b925f1

TLT decreasing, might possibly be a bounce mid day.

Be careful!

2:10 - Probably going to be shorts closing their position and a squeeze soon. If you made some profits I'd lock them in, unless you have longer dated puts.

2:55 - Bought some call options. Haven't seen big blocks yet. But I'll post the data if I see them. Usually they buy within the last 30 min.

TLT going down. Looks like they are starting to liquidate some cash to get ready for some buying.

3:10 - Insane. They really are going to bring it down to 269 to be in the money.

3:30 - Shorts starting to cover. TLT down 1%!

3:40 - Still not seeing any call big blocks. I hate these guys honestly lol. We might have more downside tomorrow if theres no big blocks. Might need to sell these calls soon or tomorrow at open

3:50.- I see some doubling down on puts. Keeping their positions.

Thinking red day tomorrow. The games man. The games.

Short cover is a bull trap. More doubling down of puts.

4:00 - Im peaked. I'll write a short update with a chart explaining their moves today.

=================================================================================

[3\/11\/20 SPY](https://preview.redd.it/ykh3xedea5m41.png?width=1680&format=png&auto=webp&s=f98f1e05f68d3b66ca1de45fdb717cae84950c9f)

Quick update, seems like it's pretty clear what's going to happen tomorrow. So how did they do it? Previously they broke back into the 285 channel, which I mentioned was a fake out. People were selling their puts due to being caught by the sudden rally to the upside. Since we broke back into the 285-315 trading range, people thought the next day would be green as well. Calls, calls, calls.

Like I mentioned before, most of the price action happens before the open. To position, you need to buy the puts/calls before on the cheap, that gets you a nice 20-30% if you time the entry well. Overnight, futures tank and break below into the 281 and 276 channel. Futures instantly lock you now 60-80% gains. I previously mentioned how a lot of this was setup to position the drop to 269, which was the strike of most of the 0 DTE puts. About 30 min before the cash open, we pump like crazy to near the 281 channel. Hint: this was done to buy even more 0 DTE puts.

[3\/11\/20 Options and Sales](https://preview.redd.it/a3n79ss7c5m41.png?width=2838&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f67b2d0f014602fd9f9c7813de50457c9ee7fb9)

SPX put after put was purchased within 9:50 to 11. Notice those 0 DTE puts. Look at how many there are. Close to 15,000. Let's just take the transaction at 9:48. for the 2805 put 2154 x 100 x $36.06 = >7,000,000. Once they loaded up, price action brought it down to 276. I noticed TLT was bleeding off, this is a good leading indicator to show that liquidity is being drawn and going to be placed somewhere. I said to be careful at 11:40. We bounce hard at 11:55. Why?

Look at who bought more puts at 11:30-11:55. These were combined with calls to form a straddle. But more puts were collected from people who sold and capitulated. But we didn't have enough momentum and sell volume. Oh wait, let's declare the pandemic now. How convenient. We start selling furiously, break 276, smash through 273, and are within striking range of 269 at 270.

This is where it gets really annoying. Shorts cover. There's a huge bounce. What did they do? 14:39, more straddles. They knew volatility will increase. Stay delta neutral. Now it's near close, around 3:40. I don't see the big blocks. What are the next moves? TLT was decreasing. There's more liquidity, when are they going to buy calls?

[3\/11\/20 SPX options and sales](https://preview.redd.it/wpgs8pybe5m41.png?width=2838&format=png&auto=webp&s=01553a638c0c0d2fcc59f0971b67e746b7360c16)

Look closely at the times. For example, 14:11, massive put buying. But broken into two parts. They started hiding their blocks by breaking them apart so they don't appear as high when people scan. This was right in the middle of that short covering. 15:02, 15:03, 15:17 massive put buying.

They sold TLT to look like they were putting money back into SPX when it was simply shorts covering. People using that indicator got duped into buying calls. Meanwhile these guys were doubling or even tripling down on more puts and accumulating losses on the move up.

So how low do we go? Simply, I don't know. We smashed through 269. We might easily hit another circuit breaker. I think the next price target is 250.8, the next fib retracement. We have a few more supports.

Anyways, guys, take care of yourselves. These days are rough. And people will be hurting and losing on retirement or jobs. Protect yourselves, and help others. Have a good night.

=================================================================================

3/12/20 Update 3 - will post updates here.

Please set limit orders when we hit a circuit breaker, the bid and ask will intentionally be set wide to front run and give you a bad fill if you place a market order.

9:37 - High possibility of possibly hitting the second circuit breaker today.

10:02 - more buying of puts. Gold drawing down. Don't see too much in treasuries. All the pieces have been set.

https://preview.redd.it/26iqjz1859m41.png?width=2838&format=png&auto=webp&s=56222fe9303ad868c519e5ceba55f26971ac0f16

See the put buying especially after 10:00. The calls are equally matched by puts, forming straddles. Ignore the super OTM puts. Look at the ones closer to the money. Mostly puts.

Closed gold puts.

11:00 - bought VXX calls and more SPY puts. **Follow these with caution.**

I think some firm got duped and got stuck with tens of millions of dollars worth of calls. They're going to start liquidating gold and TLT and try to prop up SPX to stop the bleeding.

HUGE block 6000 puts, 2300 strike. Ruthless. Simply ruthless.

12:15 - sold all my SPY puts. Hit my 251 target. Sold VXX calls.

Just have GLD puts. Waiting for near close today.

1:25 - Fed just announced QE, full nuclear option. Just for reference 500 billion is all of Q1 2019 QE. Fed is pumping more than 1.5 trillion into the markets. Waiting to see who blinks first.

2:25 - Getting a few calls. Expecting a run up, and most likely a respositioning to puts near close end of day.

Just for reference, tons of calls on SPX but even more on SPY in comparison to balance out. These indices shouldn't have such a large dichotomy. Whoever blinks first...

3:00 pm - closed SPY calls. I saw huge orders of VXX calls. The SPX calls most likely just sold to bagholders. The real accumulation is in SPY puts. Be careful.

3:05 - Bought SPY puts and VXX calls.

3:15 - This is what's going to happen. We are going to have a nice run up near end of day, as shorts cover, and TLT draws down. What's happening behind the scenes is that SPX OTM calls were sold to confuse people. What's really happening is they're buying near OTM puts around 230-253.

Tons of VXX calls bought. This is the key. There are tons of SPX calls far OTM sold, and tons of near ITM SPY puts accumulated the past few hours. Who is right? SPX or SPY?

3:30 - 12,000 SPX puts just purchased.

3:40 - I have SPY puts, VXX calls, GLD puts. Tomorrow is going to be the storm.

=================================================================================

4/12/20 Update 4 - Sorry, I know this post is getting kind of long. I just want to keep adding to here because I have no idea how long the next post will take to get approved. Want to get this information out as soon as possible. I'll make a post this weekend describing today's price action. I think it revealed a lot of information and why tomorrow is designed for a big drop as well.

https://preview.redd.it/1gsfcyjfmcm41.png?width=2122&format=png&auto=webp&s=84a4cfbd6b5d8c8504d9245cdfc208c92eb4f39b

233.8 is the December 2018 low. I think that is the lower end of tomorrow's trading range. A few days a go I said we would hit 269 and we did. Then 250 or 247.8, depending on if you're looking at /ES or SPY. Look at the red spikes of the last trading day. The sell volume is strong. There is still panic.

I have a meeting unfortunately from 3-4pm. So most likely I will just sell as we close near that December 2018 support, and go full cash into the weekend. I probably won't enter trading until Monday around 3:50 pm as per usual.

3/13/20 4:15 am - I keep getting pinged about the futures. I'm just gonna leave this here. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMShFx5rThI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMShFx5rThI)

""What's important when you're in the hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is against your view, that it's important to create a new truth, to develop a fiction.""

""You don't want to raise in May and cut in January, you look like Mexico for heaven's sake. I mean this is like a distinguished group of people who went to really good schools. They don't want to look like dopes.""

Based on the price action yesterday, based on the buying of those SPY puts, the selling of those SPX calls, the fact that constantly every single time there is some game in this week of trading, I believe that there is more going on. Sure, I may be wrong about the market today. But my position sizing will not blow up my account. Regardless, Wall Street wants 0% rates. The only way to do that is to scare the Fed. Who is really in control of the rate cuts? Who throws a fit when things don't go their way? Who is willing to take anyone down on their way when they got caught with their pants down?

I just want to say, be careful about the smoke and mirrors. Lot of things are going on underneath the surface.

8 am - Yesterday, the fed offered more than 500 billion in repo. Only 78.4 billion was taken. Today, the Fed just offered more than 1.1 trillion in repo for today. What are the signals?

This could possibly be way worse than 2008.

8:30 - 24.1 billion in repo taken. Last update will be 9am.

9:00 - 45.1 billion.

Net repo: 86.5 billion out of 1.15 trillion

9:05 - Brace yourselves.

9:18 - Mnuchin says coronavirus sell-off will be great opportunity for long-term investors like ‚Äô87 crash -CNBC

Sounds like he knows something.

9:25 - Set a stop loss for your positions. If a loss exceeds your threshold it will be sold at market price. This also helps set good limits to your trading.

10:15 - Tons of SPY puts purchased around 9:45. Tons of SPX puts. Both SPX and SPY order flow is the same.

11:15 - Selling VXX calls and GLD puts. Holding SPY puts, but watching TLT puts and seeing if there are tranches of calls for SPX or SPY.

Unloading puts slowly. I'm seeing these smaller 1-2000 spx calls peppered in. I think the mass selling of puts is just to collect premium and they sneak the smaller spx call orders. This lines up with TLT puts, and also lines up with VXX puts.

11:20 - Trump to declare national emergency.

11:25 - Sold puts.

11:27 - Call orders starting to come in. Going to go start a small position with calls.

Please be careful!

13:10 - Don't think many people will know what happens until the 3pm conference. Lot of straddles being played on SPX.  Seeing more VXX calls. Lot of uncertainty.

Nicely doubling your bet is not something you typically do with options, that‚Äôs what you do with roulette when betting on black.  It was just too clean.  Of course, it was also very lucky and extremely ballsy‚Äîneither of which is uncommon on WSB.

>4:55pm me: ""Not good enough sorry.""

Then there was bickering back and forth about what standard of proof meant, and what we could do about it until u/WSBgod capitulated.

At 5:18pm He accepted the screenshare which we did shortly after.

***

We went on discord and he shared his screen, where he had a chrome window up with a couple of tabs open to vanguard, one of which was logged in and had a clearly visible **SSL** icon to the left of the address.  He scrolled around (without hitting the top of the screen where his name/account would show).  Once he was done showing me the numbers, I asked him to refresh the page.  He then took the discord window and carefully placed it such that it covered only the contents of the website to hide his name from showing up after the refresh.   The ‚Äúdiscord censor window‚Äù was small enough so that I could see the address bar at all times, and most of the contents of the webpage.  There was no keyboard shortcuts‚Äîeverything was done by mouse.  He clicked the refresh button, and after a visible refresh of the site, he moved the ‚Äúdiscord censor window‚Äù and showed me that all the numbers remained the same.

***

I‚Äôve taken the video and edited it such that it removes all personal information, but I can‚Äôt in good conscience publish it without his consent.  Doing so would eliminate the possibility of anybody ever trusting me (or the mods) with any sort of proof again, and for that reason I will wait and hope to get permission to post it.  Otherwise this is the extent of what I‚Äôm sharing.

So the question remains, could this be fake? Absofuckinglutely.  Could he fake the url, website, broker summary, ssl certificates and inspect/refresh? Yes.  Of course it can be faked.  For all the retard talk that‚Äôs thrown around, you all are actually really fucking capable (you‚Äôve proved it time and time again).  I‚Äôm not saying that u/WSBgod‚Äôs claims are irrefutable, I‚Äôm just laying out the proof he gave me.

When people make huge ass claims, as mods, the best we can do is ask for ‚Äúproof.‚Äù  Short of asking for his username and password, this was the closest thing that I could think of and I gave him a very short window of time.  Never in the history of WSB have I ever asked to log into somebody‚Äôs computer to see their screen. There‚Äôs no precedent for that and there‚Äôs no reason for him to have anticipated that.  u/fscomeau faked a video but he filmed, edited it on his own time and uploaded it to youtube.  In today‚Äôs case, I gave u/WSBgod less than 2 hours to let me on his computer and he did exactly what I asked him to do once I was watching his screen.  As a mod, that is as much proof as I can reasonably ask somebody to give me.  And as a mod, I'm sharing it with you.  If there‚Äôs a better method of proof, I‚Äôm open to ideas.  If he faked it, then congrats to him for doing a good job at faking and anticipating my response when asking for proof.  And if he made money then congrats to him for scoring big.

The last note I‚Äôll share is his account balance **did not show $8 million dollars**.  The total balance was slightly less, but it was pretty damn close.  

I‚Äôll let you decide for yourselves based on this information and I hope to be able to post the video soon.",1581086078.0,632,jartek,1,wsb,1

Thanks to me UPRO and TMF now are 50% stress tests on TOS, no margin reduction credit, and from 36% and 24% stress tests respectively. Or maybe I'm on reg-t when I took the screenshot, IDK and IDC. Talking with risk management apparently I flew under the radar as they didn't see a margin balance due to the box spread until other account alerts went off as customer service will take a look in when anyone is negative 1 million or more PnL as a courtesy to chat with their clients. Needless to say customer service was horrified and I got another margin phone call to wire in $1,250,000 in the next five minutes or they'd liquidate. I guess they give Portfolio Margin customers a little bit more leeway... 

I took the five minutes to grab this one final screenshot. I'm hoping for some bailout money from coronavirus too. 

I talked with the bankruptcy lawyer that set me up with the asset protection plan and he already dropped me as a client. I never imagined beer-virus would do this to me. 

I'm gonna take some time to just not think about the virus or anything else.

Order 66: The Revenge of the Bears,frcuzr,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/frcuzr/order_66_the_revenge_of_the_bears/,"**I. Is the Rally Over?**

The bear market rally is gaining exhaustion. During the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak, markets fell from 116.79 on SPY to 80.63, representing a decline of \~31%. This year, we reached ATH on SPY at 338.34 and bounced, closing at 222.95, representing a retrace of \~34%. Curiously enough, if you look at the first major decline in 1929, the first drop was also \~34%.

There's a few things to note: the time it took from ATH to our temporary bottom was 23 days. During the reflexive or relief rally, we closed at 261.2 on Thursday, which is a rebound of 17% based on the close.

The time it took to rally was 3 days. What do these numbers mean? In just 13% of the time it took for our decline, we rebounded almost 20%. What about Friday? We had a significant decline, most likely as firms and funds did not want to hold positions over the weekend resulting in selling.

[SPY 1 Yr\/1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/inzw8a5mwnp41.png?width=1968&format=png&auto=webp&s=f04cc9dbeda986d4be850fb84930e1197b66696b)

What about the volume? Selling volume rapidly increased, peaking near a volume of 400 million shares which corresponded to a temporary bounce. Selling volume decreased before peaking once more at 400 million shares until it eventually subsided at 218.26. What happened to the buying volume during the rally? We peaked on Wednesday. Buying volume has declined rapidly from Thursday and Friday as shown in the blue circle.

**II. The Case for Climbing Higher**

After passing the senate vote for the stimulus bill, the market rallied through the afternoon on Thursday before hitting a wall at 259. It stayed almost completely flat, where at this point, a large battle was playing out to contest the direction of the market. Was the stimulus bill enough to push the rally higher and break past 265 to eventually open 269 and even 300? We had an eye popping push to 263 in nearly the last minute of trading.

[SPY 10 D\/30 min](https://preview.redd.it/ylt9ob273op41.png?width=1968&format=png&auto=webp&s=23fc07869de1b949c43582dc11c987d9e4be0c96)

Friday, the stimulus bill passed and we began retracing to the highs of yesterday. Ultimately, we never got there and most buyers sold off into the weekend. But WSB cries out, ""it's a bullish engulfing candle""! Let's take a look at some other evidence.

**III. Dark Pools and Gamma Exposure**

While the actions of market participants may be obscured, the actions of MM will follow a certain predictable pattern. In the case of an institution purchasing a collar, short OTM puts are offset with the sale of a long OTM call. On the other hand of this transaction is a MM who sells the short OTM put and purchases the long OTM call.

[GEX in orange, SPX in blue](https://preview.redd.it/xy1r4d474op41.png?width=548&format=png&auto=webp&s=119dc2b06002ab6862e73893d23969808b80cd83)

When people are scrambling to purchase options to hedge, this is reflected in two areas. One is in volatility, which is more of a reflection for the *expected* demand of options 1 month out (this is a great simplification). The other is in gamma exposure, or GEX as given by Squeezemetrics. In this case, net gamma exposure will dramatically decrease as the selling of put options results in negative gamma for MM. These positions need to be delta hedged due to an imbalance of the gamma. This is a little counterintuitive, but during negative gamma exposure, MM actually contribute towards selling (delta hedging) since gamma becomes lower once an OTM put becomes ITM and simultaneously increasing expected volatility.

What happens when the gamma flips, and MM are instead long gamma? In other words, what happens when there is less demand for hedging and instead firms are purchasing short OTM calls and selling long OTM puts? MM on the other side of the trade now purchase more long calls and have increased, positive gamma. To counteract this positive gamma, MM actively start buying shares (delta hedging) to reduce this gamma exposure, especially if the stock price starts declining, limiting more downside.

[DIX in orange, SPX in blue](https://preview.redd.it/zt0zgzv54op41.png?width=549&format=png&auto=webp&s=513ebd20beac85d1ec3c1dd51d80001d0fd6a167)

This can be reflected in the amount of trading within dark pools. For example, prior to the gamma flip, net gamma exposure was highly positive. During the first wave of selling, net gamma exposure was positive. After the gamma flip, dark pool activity significantly increased as MM subsequently needed to delta hedge their positions by increasing selling into the market as well. As selling leveled off at the bottom, gamma again flipped to positive, corresponding to huge increases in dark pool activity increased. From Squeezemetrics,

>Very high relative percentages (‚â•45%) of dollar-weighted short volume (DIX) are associated with mean 60-market-day returns of 5.3%.

GEX has flipped to negative once more, and DIX appears to be losing momentum. The next few days will be interesting to see what the trends really are.

**IV. Summary**

What about commodities such as gold and oil? What about volatility? What about options flows? I've talked at length in my previous posts at what to look at and what I have observed. I leave it to you guys to take a look and figure them out.

**tl;dr Possibility of climbing higher to retest 265 as money flows back in, along with final EOM rebalancing. Drop imminent.**

**tl;dr of tl;dr bears have smaller DIX.**

3/29/20 5pm EST - Bids lining up at 2460 on /ES already.

Slowing the spread for another month. Much surprise.

&#x200B;

For numbers, like I said the backtest at 265 will be critical. If it holds and breaks that level, upside. Need to see below 247 and ideally 233 to truly start the next leg down.

10:28pm EST - Pretty clear rejection of 2507 so far. We will see what happens in the morning though. Expect it to test it multiple times in the night.

3/30/20 - Updates here.

9:20 EST - gap filled from the gap down.

10:40 - Looks like back on the way to test 265.

11:45 - Picked up some TVIX.

12:30pm - Catch you guys in a few hours to see those 10 million volume candles.

EOD update: Just a thought. Tomorrow probably will break past 265, bounce around 268. Fade end of day to sit at 265.

Wednesday/Thursday? That's where things start getting interesting.

7:45pm - Quick update on DIX since I'm getting a lot of questions.

>Very high relative percentages (‚â•45%) of dollar-weighted short volume are associated with mean 60-market-day returns of 5.3%, as compared to a mean of 2.8% across the whole dataset.

https://preview.redd.it/xvt78m50naq41.png?width=2108&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b23beabca9d7ecd453475367abf26f478a93519

Returns have never been negative with a DIX over 50% in a 60 day period. What this suggests is that we in all likelihood hit a bottom within 2 months. This fits with a timeline of a bottom between April-May, with a recovery into June/July.

Just thinking aloud here, but if we do, then we probably bottom around 197 by end of April/early May, before starting our recovery. Just want to caution, there has never been data for 08-09 for DIX. So this correlation may **not** hold. But it is something to watch for.

This makes sense to me, the truth always lies somewhere between extremes.

Check this post by /u/greyacademy, it surprisingly has a lot of future patterns I have in mind... I will write a post more in depth in a new post this weekend.

&#x200B;

Guys... it's April 1. Stop reading too much about DIX.

4/2/20 9am - People who were surprised about futures shouldn't be. I briefly mentioned oil breaking out of its channel. It went up more than 10% based on the news cycle, so it was to be expected that equities climb as well.

Quick note, I also mentioned that in order for the algos to not keeping bidding up, unemployment numbers had to be close to 7 million. Consensus expectations were around 5-6 million. Don't trust the numbers you see on CNBC.

We had a selloff below the decade trendline in yellow. Pure price action at this point, stabilizing near 246. Next area I see is 244 (green bar to the left), the lows of yesterday, and on the way to testing 233.

Battle again at 247.

10:48am - Trump pump with the oil manipulation. Big squeeze going on.

10:55am - Added into UUP positions. Between 28-30.

11:40am - People keep asking about gold puts. It's a contrarian trade. In brief, a stronger dollar is not good for commodities like oil and gold. I'm trading under the expectation that there  will be a large divergence between the dollar and commodities. I expect a huge dislocation in the price of gold which will also coincide with equities falling off.

This is dependent upon if my original idea of the price points that I previously laid out. I stopped intraday trading and finalized my positions. You need to trade with a road map. Only then can you have the conviction to take the initial pain and see through to the other end.

I've said for awhile now.... Thursday and Friday are going to determine the direction of the market. Today is the most important trading day of the year.

12:46pm - Nice Tweet explaining what's going on.  Same trading range. [https://twitter.com/MarkNewtonCMT/status/1245751333166166017](https://twitter.com/MarkNewtonCMT/status/1245751333166166017)

4/4/20 - Some food for thought. Was wondering how Venezuela fits into the picture. The US primarily produces light sweet crude, and needs around $40/barrel in order for most of the shale industry not to go out of business.

The US is a net importer of heavy crude. Thus, the argument for tariffs is not viable. In terms of the  deal, pretty much no deal. Expecting a gap down on Sunday night. Based on some consensus, even if an agreement was reached, capacity limit will be exceeded by May which would crash prices again.

Interestingly, Venezuela has one of the largest reserves of heavy crude in the world. The Trump administration already does not recognize Maduro as the legitimate leader and already has well established ties with Guaid√≥. Remember he was at the last state of union address. Will be interesting to see how this plays out. Would it be possible the US can achieve energy independence from SA and Russia through Venezuela? Not sure.

Areas I'm looking at. If we go above at 263, then I will likely close my puts. But not until then.

4/6/20 - Lot of fear and anxiety. The easy money was made for sure. The timing will be difficult. The  funds and other tutes will be manipulating like crazy and playing a lot of games.

Need to have levels. Haven't broke past 265 yet => holding to see the outcome of this week.

Orders coming in above the bid. Might be a week of pain. But I leave it you guys to decide what's going to happen.

2:15pm - Rally be damned if we go higher this week. Come back to me EOM.

Closed under 265. Let's see what tomorrow brings.

7:36 - Probably hit around 270 tomorrow. Expect Thursday to sell off as people place hedges and take risk off before the long weekend.

8:30 - Again, possibly squeezing to 276. Last update until near EOM. See you guys on the other side of this.

Getting a lot of DM's and negativity from others.

Mortgage Servicing Crisis Explained,friwc9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/friwc9/mortgage_servicing_crisis_explained/,"Pre:TLDR - it‚Äôs super long, if you aren‚Äôt full retard and want to understand this, read it. If you don‚Äôt have the brainpower, there a TLDR. 

I'm a Loan Officer for one of the larger retail lenders. Here‚Äôs an overview of how the Fed gone and fucked over mortgage lenders. 

Credit for the content below should go to Barry Habib of MBS Highway. 

THE CORONAVIRUS MELTDOWN
The current coronavirus crisis is having a critical impact on the mortgage industry, which could potentially make the 2008 financial crisis pale in comparison. The pressing issue centers around capital that's required by Mortgage Lenders to be able to function and meet covenants that are required for them to continue to lend. 

HERES HOW THE MORTGAGE MARKET WORKS
Let's begin with the mortgage process. A borrower goes to a Mortgage Originator to obtain a mortgage. Once closed, the loan is handled by a Servicer, which may or may not be the same company that originated the loan. The borrower submits payments to the Servicer, however, the Servicer does not own the loan, they are simply maintaining the loan. This means collecting payments and forwarding them to the investor (Fannie/Freddie/Ginnie), paying taxes and insurance, and answering questions, etc. While they maintain or ""service"" the loan, the asset itself is sold to an aggregator or directly to a government agency like Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Ginnie Mae. The loan then gets placed in a large bundle, which is put in the hands of an Investment Banker. The Investment Banker converts those loans into a Mortgage Backed Security (MBS) that can be sold to the public. This shows up in different investments like Mutual Funds, Insurance Plans, and Retirement Accounts. 

The Servicer's role is very critical. In order to obtain the right to service loans, the Servicer will typically pay 1% of the loan amount up front. The Servicer then receives a monthly payment or ""strip"" equal to about 30 basis points (bps) per year. Because they paid about 1% to obtain the servicing rights and receive roughly 30 bps annual income, the breakeven period is approximately 3 years. The longer that loan remains on the books, the more money the Servicer makes. In many cases, the Servicer may want to use leverage to increase their level of income. Therefore, they may often finance half the cost of acquiring the loan and pay the rest in cash. 

SERVICER DILEMMA
As you can imagine, when interest rates drop dramatically, there is an increased incentive for many people to refinance their loans more rapidly. This causes the loans that a Servicer had on their books to pay off sooner‚Ä¶often before that 3-year breakeven period. This servicing runoff creates losses for that Mortgage Lender who is servicing the loan. The more loans in a Mortgage Lender‚Äôs portfolio, the greater the loss. Servicing runoff, or even the anticipation of it, can adversely impact the market valuation of a servicing portfolio. But at the same time, Lenders typically experience an increase in new loan activity because of the decline in interest rates. This gives them additional income to help overcome the losses in their servicing portfolio. 

But the Coronavirus has caused a virtual shutdown of the US economy, which has created an unprecedented amount of job losses. This adds a new risk to the servicer because borrowers may have difficulty paying their mortgage in a timely manner. And although the Servicer does not own the asset, they have the responsibility to make the payment to the investor, even if they have not yet received it from the borrower. Under normal circumstances, the Servicer has plenty of cushion to account for this. But an extreme level of delinquency puts the Servicer in an unmanageable position.

I'M FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND I'M HERE TO HELP
In the Government‚Äôs effort to help those who have lost their jobs because of the Coronavirus shutdown, they have granted forbearance of mortgage payments for affected individuals. This presents an enormous obstacle for Servicers who are obligated to forward the mortgage payment to the investor, even though they have not yet received it. Fortunately, there is a new facility set up to help Mortgage Servicers bridge the gap to the investor. However, it is unclear as to how long it will take for Servicers to access this facility.

But what has not been yet contemplated is the fact that a borrower who does not make their first mortgage payment causes the loan to be ineligible to be sold to an investor. This means that the Servicer must hold onto the asset itself, which ties up their available credit. And with so many new loans being originated of late, the amount of transactions that will not qualify for sale is significant. This restricts the Lender‚Äôs ability to clear their pipeline and get reimbursed with cash so they can now fund new transactions.

MARK TO MARKET
This week - Due to accelerated prepayments and the uncertainty of repayment, the value of servicing was slashed in half from 1% to 0.5%. This drastic decrease in value prompted margin calls for the many Servicers who financed their acquisition of servicing. Additionally, the decreased value of a Lender‚Äôs servicing portfolio reduces the Lender‚Äôs overall net worth. Since the amount a lender can lend is based on a multiple of their net worth, the decrease in value of their servicing portfolio asset, along with the cash paid for margin calls, reduces their capacity to lend.

UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES
The Fed‚Äôs desire to bring mortgage rates down isn‚Äôt just damaging servicing portfolios because of prepayments, it‚Äôs also wreaking chaos in Lenders‚Äô ability to hedge their risk. Let‚Äôs look at what happens when a borrower locks in their mortgage rate with a Mortgage Lender. Mortgage rates are based on the trading of Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS). As Mortgage Backed Securities rise in price, interest rates improve and move lower. A locked rate on a loan is nothing more than a lender promising to hold an interest rate for a period of time, or until the transaction closes. The Lender is at risk for any MBS price changes in the marketplace between the time they agreed to grant the lock and the time that the loan closes.

If rates were to rise because MBS prices declined, the Lender would be obligated to buy down the borrower‚Äôs mortgage rate to the level they were promised. And since the Lender doesn‚Äôt want to be in a position of gambling, they hedge their locked loans by shorting Mortgage Backed Securities. Therefore, should MBS drop in price, causing rates to rise, the Lender‚Äôs cost to buy down the borrower‚Äôs rate is offset by the Lender‚Äôs gains of their short positions in MBS.

Now think about what happens when MBS prices rise or improve, causing mortgage rates to decline. On paper the Lender should be able to close the mortgage loan at a better price than promised to the borrower, giving the Lender additional profits. However, the Lender‚Äôs losses on their short position negate any additional profits from the improvement in MBS pricing. This hedging system works well to deliver the borrower what was promised, while removing market risk from the Lender.

But in an effort to reduce mortgage rates, the Fed has been purchasing an incredible amount of Mortgage Backed Securities, causing their price to rise dramatically and swiftly. This, in turn, causes the Lenders‚Äô hedged short positions of MBS to show huge losses. These losses appear to be offset on paper by the potential market gains on the loans that the lender hopes to close in the future. But the Broker Dealer will not wait on the possibility of future loans closing and demands an immediate margin call. The recent amount that these Lenders are paying in margin calls are staggering. They run in the tens of millions of Dollars. All this on top of the aforementioned stresses that Lenders are having to endure. So, while the Fed believes they are stimulating lending, their actions are resulting in the exact opposite. The market for Government Loans, Jumbo Loans, and loans that don‚Äôt fit ideal parameters, have all but dried up. And many Lenders have no choice but to slow their intake of transactions by throttling mortgage rates higher and by reducing the term that they are willing to guarantee a rate lock.

Furthering the Fed‚Äôs unintended consequences was the announcement to cut interest rates on the Fed Funds Rate by 1% to virtually zero. Because the Fed‚Äôs communication failed to educate the general public that the Fed Funds Rate is very different than mortgage rates, it prompted borrowers in process to break their locks and try to jump ship to a lower rate. This dramatically increased hedging losses from loans that didn‚Äôt end up closing.

EVEN STEPHEN KING COULD NOT HAVE SCRIPTED THIS
It‚Äôs been said that the Stock market will do the most damage, to the most people, at the worst time. And the current mortgage market is experiencing the most perfect storm. Just when volume levels were at the highest in history, servicing runoff at its peak, and pipelines hedged more than ever, the Coronavirus arrived.
Lenders need to clear their pipelines, but social distancing is making it more difficult for transactions to be processed. And those loans that are about to close require that employment be verified. As you can imagine, with millions of individuals losing their jobs, those mortgages are unable to fund, leaving lenders with more hedging losses and no income to offset it.

WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE NOW
Fortunately, there are many smart people in the Mortgage Industry who are doing everything they can to navigate through these perilous times. But the Fed and our Government needs to stop making it more difficult. The Fed must temporarily slow MBS purchases to allow pipelines to clear. Lawmakers need to allow for first payment defaults, due to forbearance, to be saleable. And finally, the Fed must more clearly communicate that Mortgage Rates and the Fed Funds Rate are not the same. We have faith that the effects of the Coronavirus will subside and that things will become more normalized in the upcoming months.


So, that‚Äôs what‚Äôs going on - I‚Äôd love some input on the best way to use this info for trades. Personally I think that mid-sized loan servicers with minimal diversity are most at risk. Quicken isn't publicly traded, Wells Fargo is too big for their mortgage servicing alone to cripple them. 

Edit: adding this - There are three main issues:
1.) margin call
2.) inability to sell recently originated loans with a forbearance in place prior to the first payment
3.) a servicer still needs to pay Fannie/Freddie/Ginnie even if someone with an existing loan is in forbearance 

These can combine to be a huge cash burn. The fix for #1 is just that the Fed stops buying MBS but the second two require legislation. 

So, what servicers are at risk? 

EDIT MADE: I‚Äôm an idiot and the original post contained some figures for commercial MBS servicing by banks.

Originally I proposed a ticker weighted in CMBS and someone pointed out I‚Äôm an idiot. A couple people have commented COOP - Mr. Cooper has a $548B servicing portfolio, which is massive. They aren‚Äôt a bank and are solely a mortgage lender/servicer, so I do like that play. 

So, 10/16 COOP 5p

Edit 4: Here is proof of me texting my friend who actually is an engineer who worked on the YouInvest app, right after I saw the Review message. I believe around that time the prices were still consistent https://imgur.com/gallery/jsUt8ws

EDIT: Thanks for being so helpful, wsb community. I'm hoping this will grab Chase's attention.  
EDIT 2: Filed a FINRA compaint like a lot of you suggested
EDIT 3: open to lawyer connections here. I have a full time job at a small startup so am exhausted to even do all this legal research. I‚Äôd offer 10% of what I‚Äôm owed.

I got into options because of the volatile market, did my due diligence. I signed up with Chase JPM as my brokerage: big mistake.

Long story short, I bought some SNAP calls and NOK Puts during late March.  Later, both options shot straight up in value, SNAP call at \~5000%, and the NOK put at \~$8000 %, totaling in around $25,000 in profits. Price per contract when I bought: SNAP 0.16 NOK 0.06. Day contract price shooting up was March 18th.

Picture Evidence: [Imgur Snapshot of My Youinvest](https://imgur.com/gallery/YztbkaK)

Picture of purchase receipt: https://imgur.com/gallery/lrNh9Hy

I tried to submit the order to Close, but Chase YouInvest gives me a message saying

""Due to the Large Amount Orders Rule, your order will be reviewed.""

Guess what? They kept it under review status all day long, and eventually the contracts expired worthless.

So I called customer support to ask them about this review process, and they said""Any Options orders that total in $5000 in transactions must be reviewed by our team"".

They refused to lift the review policy from my account, and 2 weeks since the incident still have not heard back about the $25000 loss.

Do not use YouInvest. I‚Äôm relatively new to stocks and options but this seems pretty close to fraud to me.",1586239982.0,550,gitpullhoes,1,wsb,1

When you place an options order, Robinhood will hold the appropriate collateral (cash or stock) beginning at the pending state. We‚Äôll hold enough cash or stock to cover your option position until the order is canceled.

If an order is filled that requires additional collateral, Robinhood will hold the credit that you received from opening the order plus any additional necessary collateral. The collateral we hold for these purposes is not marginable.

I'm a cuck and my boss made me come in on a Saturday, so I decided to do some more DD on this investment opportunity. I created an account at [buildingdetroit.org](https://buildingdetroit.org) and it turns out that Detroit city employees can get these homes for 50% off. The land itself has to be worth more than $500. I am proposing that the WSB community apply for positions within the Detroit city government. First, we need to get some autists to work in the HR department. An unlimited amount of positions could be created within the government.  We are also going to need some autists to work in the tax department so that we can get rid of the tax liens. There also seemed to be some concern about the asbestos issue in the original thread. The asbestos would give us access to mesothelioma money you always hear about on TV, which could, in turn, be yeeted back into the market. I don't see how this could go tits up.",1579400404.0,351,jhowe13,1,wsb,1

I tried finding the store that sells Tesla apparel online,  but I could only find hats and shirts,  no shorts. I don't know what to do or where to start looking.  Someone help?",1572019072.0,189,heapsp,1,wsb,1
APRIL PUTS bag holders.. so ya portfolio looking like the total opposite of what your expecting huh?,fo642x,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fo642x/april_puts_bag_holders_so_ya_portfolio_looking/,"Let me guess, after quadruple witching failed, you guys all went to sleep during the weekend thinking this week our lambos and teslas will be printed by the end of this week huh?

Let me guess, you also couldn't wait for this coming monday to huh? thought it was going to be blooody monday huh?

Let me guess, you had one or even two circuit breakers planned for Monday huh?

Let me guess, those so called 'diamond hands' you have are starting to deteriorate into 'paper hands'

Let me guess, your asshole is clinching every time you look at your portfolio?

Do me a favour... GROW A PAIR YOU FUCKING PUSSY. You think we came this far to fold? From getting fucked quadruply from witches left right and centre, getting fucked by the stimulus bill every week, getting fucked by retarded bulls week in and week out. You think we're here to fold? YOU THINK WE CAME THIS FAR TO SELL BEFORE APRIL?

**ARE YOU DUMB OR ARE YOU DUMB?**

do me a fucking favour, go to the closest mirror thats in your vicinity, loook in the mirror and slap yourself so hard that theres an echo in the room. Slap yourself so hard so you realize that your not drunk, its the markets. We will wait for the markets to sober up, we will wait when the president shuts down the whole country, we will wait when the unemployment numbers come out, we WILL follow suit with italy's economy and europe's economy (unfortunately), we will have more cases and panic.. this fucking list goes on.

**BIG RALLY = BIG FALL**

Remember, it doesn't matter how much money the feds offer coronavirus, the ronazz will keep on taking. We gave that bitch TRILLIONS and she still wants more? Us fucking bears realize that whatever amount of money we offer the ronazz it wont be enough. the ronazzz wants the WHOLE FUCKING WORLD, not a couple of trillions. SMARTEN UP BEARS. You weak bears are embarrassing us running around this forum crying that your puts are down.

ANY SPORTS BETTORS OUT THERE?

Sports betting (live odds) = options trading, IMO. Except live odds are priced in with time decay, and the greeks priced in with point spreads, better qb, better coach.. etc for sports. lets play football NFL for example:

**APRIL PUTS BAG HOLDERS WE ARE IN THE FUCKING SUPERBOWL RIGHT NOW** NOT MAY HOLDERS OR JUNE BAG HOLDERS. WE ARE. APRIL FUCKING HOLDERS. 

WE ARE ONLY IN THE FIRST QUARTER. FIRST HALF. NOT EVEN IN THE SECOND HALF YET.

The fucking superbowl **HALF TIME SHOW**(country lockdown, unemployment numbers, aggressive testing, supply chains disruptions, earning and sales) **HASN'T EVEN FUCKING STARTED YET**

**HOLD THE FUCKING LINE.**

**TL/DR** bears panicking right now, do me a ANOTHER favour, go to the fucking washroom, open up this link [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ikSfs9LETc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ikSfs9LETc) and stare at the mirror and follow what hes doing in the song. BEAT YOUR FUCKING CHEST HARDER AS THE SONG PROGRESSES, HUM LOUDER, BELIEVE HARDER AND STOP BEING A FUCKING PUSSY AND ..

**HOLD THE FUCKING LINE.**

**HOLD THE FUCKING LINE. SCARED MONEY DON'T MAKE NO MONEY. DIAMONDS FUCKING HANDS.**


EDIT#2 so much vaccine talks/cures. let me tell you something. I was alive when sars got introduced to the world. CV is even worse. they are both from the same family, the same strain. if we had a vaccine or a cure or something to suppress its rapid growth, we would have it by now and we would be working on a vaccine towards CV. reality is, they don't have one. everything is trial and error right now. clinical research trials takes years to produce and test. they are not going to come up with a vaccine before summer. stop being naive. look at the hard core facts with sars. there is no cure.
