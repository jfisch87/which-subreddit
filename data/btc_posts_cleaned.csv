I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes! Introducing The Pineapple Fund,7jj0oa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7jj0oa/im_donating_5057_btc_to_charitable_causes/,"Hello! 

I remember staring at bitcoin a few years ago. When bitcoin broke single digits for the first time, I thought that was a triumphant moment for bitcoin. I watched and admired the price jump to $15.. $20.. $30.. wow!

Today, I see $17,539 per BTC. I still don't believe reality sometimes. Bitcoin has changed my life, and I have far more money than I can ever spend. My aims, goals, and motivations in life have nothing to do with having XX million or being the mega rich. So I'm doing something else: donating the majority of my bitcoins to charitable causes. I'm calling it üçç The Pineapple Fund.

Yes, donating ~$86 million worth of bitcoins to charities :)

So far, The Pineapple Fund has/is:

* Donated $1 million to Watsi, an impressively innovative charity building technology to finance universal healthcare.

* Donated $1 million to The Water Project, a charity providing sustainable water projects to suffering communities in Africa

* Donating $1 million to the EFF, defending rights and privacy of internet users, fighting for net neutrality, and far far more

* Donated $500k to BitGive Foundation, a charity building projects that leverage bitcoin and blockchain technology for global philanthropy. 

If you know a registered nonprofit charity, please encourage them to apply on the fund's website! While I prefer supporting registered charities, I am open to supporting charitable causes as well. Check out the website :)

All transactions are posted on the website for full transparency :)

**Edit.**

Thanks for all your suggestions and support.

I've received news from localbitcoins, I will update this once the authorities get in touch and decide course of action.

&#x200B;

In may 2015  [/BTC-OTC/](https://localbitcoins.com/p/BTC-OTC/)  scammed me and other 6 persons using bank transfer chargeback which led to my bank account being closed and all my funds frozen for 45 days.  At the time BTC-OTC  was one of the most reputable traders on  Localbitcoins.

I  shortly reported this to localbitcoins.com whitch led to BTC-OTC's account being banned and funds being locked - [HERE](https://puu.sh/BhjCz/37f0ab1fc8.png)  also made a police fraud complaint to the relevant authority in UK

Localbitcoins freezed the funds stating the following in my support ticket  - [HERE](https://puu.sh/BhmDT/0a136c253b.png)

Since then I've been actively trying to get my coins with no result receiving only one single reply on my support ticket in 8 months

When contacting Max on linkedin his reply was - [HERE](http://puu.sh/BhmJU/01610eaef4.png)

When contacting Max on reddit his reply was - [ HERE](http://puu.sh/BhmIn/71ff537bcf.png)   nevertheless 6 months passed with no reply on my ticket.

I emailed  Jeremias Kangas (CEO & Founder of LBC)  with no success. Also in my numerous visits at Metropolitan Police with this issue I was advised the same, this is a localbitcoins.com customer service issue not a legal issue.

Police official statement on my complaint   -  [ HERE](https://puu.sh/BhmOd/9045da5342.png)

National Fraud Intelligence Bureau advised  to change my fraud complaint against localbitcoins in order for them to investigate and contact localbitcoins regarding the case.

After 6 months of waiting, Max's reply was - [HERE](http://puu.sh/BhmTD/d93973a8bf.png) , after sharing all the info on both support ticket and email he replied on email   [HERE](https://puu.sh/BhmXK/a213a8d27b.png)

I knew this won't go anywhere so meanwhile I found a Metropolitan Police Sergeant specialized in blockchain and cyber-crime that understood this issue and decided to help me by contacting them using the fraud report I made in 2015.

Almost 2 months passed since he contacted localbitcoins (3 times) receiving no reply.

Reason I'm posting this is because  there are other 5 persons in this very situation, also other hundreds based on the posts complaining online.

Now I'm in the process of taking legal action. I've been in contact with over 40 lawyers from Finland, and found only 2 that are looking to take this case and quoted me at ‚Ç¨10.000 to  ‚Ç¨15.000 for civil proceedings,

Finnish Law allows only Ombudsman to initiate  a class action lawsuit so this can be settled only in civil court

Us Senate Bill S.1241 to criminalize concealed ownership of Bitcoin,7iey6q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iey6q/us_senate_bill_s1241_to_criminalize_concealed/,"On November 28, 2017, the US Senate, Committee of the Judiciary held a hearing regarding bill S.1241: Modernizing AML Laws to Combat Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing. Despite little attention being given to digital currencies during the hearing, bill S.1241 itself would amend the definition of ‚Äòfinancial institution‚Äô in the United States Code to include digital currencies and digital exchanges. This could have alarming consequences for users of cryptocurrencies both in the US and abroad.

Bill S.1241 would amend the definition of ‚Äòfinancial institution,‚Äô in Section 5312(a) of title 31, United States Code, to include ‚Äúan issuer, redeemer, or cashier of prepaid access devices, digital currency, or any digital exchanger or tumbler of digital currency.‚Äù Currently, the definition of ‚Äòfinancial institution‚Äô includes banks, trust companies, credit unions, currency exchanges, etc.

In her introduction, Mrs. Feinstein, Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee, said (31:35), ‚ÄúThe bill criminalizes intentionally concealing ownership or control of a bank account.‚Äù Although, during the hearing, no further clarifications were given as to the effects this would have on the cryptocurrency community, based on the amended definition of ‚Äòfinancial institution‚Äô, it seems clear enough that the bill would ‚Äúcriminalize [those] intentionally concealing ownership or control of a [digital currency or digital exchange] account.‚Äù Wow. Let this sink in for a minute‚Ä¶

The US senate is proposing a bill to make criminals out of anyone intentionally concealing ownership or control of a digital currency or digital exchange account. What‚Äôs more, according to the hearing‚Äôs prolonged discussion of US law enforcement‚Äôs handling of foreign banks and financial institutions, this bill is certain to have far-reaching effects on not only US citizens but the global community as a whole.

If the above statement describes you, it is strongly recommended that you watch the hearing with this new definition of ‚Äòfinancial institution‚Äô in mind. If you‚Äôve already watched the hearing, watch it again, but this time replace all mentions of ‚Äòbanks and financial institutions‚Äô with ‚Äòdigital currencies and digital exchanges.‚Äô The implications are really rather alarming.

Interestingly enough, Ms. Kathryn Haun Rodriguez, a Coinbase Board of Directors Member, made absolutely no mention of digital currencies or digital exchanges in her testimony; nor was she asked any questions pertaining to these topics.

Conversely, in her July 2017 written testimony to the US House of Representatives Committee on Financial Services and Subcommittee on Terrorism and Illicit Finance, she stated that some users of digital currencies use them ‚Äúto conceal and move illicit proceeds because of the perception that virtual currency is untraceable.‚Äù

Also in her prior written testimony, she stated that ‚Äúthe FinTech industry could be a very helpful partner to the government in addressing national security concerns;‚Äù that ‚Äúinvestigators like digital footprints and that is exactly what digital currencies provide;‚Äù and that ‚Äúof course, we can only follow the money to an individual or group if they used a Regulated exchange, one that follows basic AML/KYC laws.‚Äù Advertisement

Contrary to the bill itself, the hearing was noticeably lacking in references to cryptocurrencies; although there was some limited mention of such.

Ms. Klobuchar (2:16:58):

‚ÄúIs this transition we‚Äôre seeing from cash to digital going to make it easier or harder for law enforcement to track these money laundering cases, and you think these drug cartels are gonna start going cash free, and what do you do about it?‚Äù
Mr. John A. Cassara (2:17:15):

‚ÄúSenator, I‚Äôm just glad I had my career when I did because I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd do trying to follow the money when it comes to digital currencies, it‚Äôs extremely, extremely challenging‚Ä¶I think if you look at the metrics, the metrics suggest today [that] digital currencies are a small fraction of the threat that we face. That‚Äôs not to say it‚Äôs gonna be the case in 5-10 years from now. We‚Äôre right at a crossroads, and it‚Äôs going to be very, very interesting to see what goes forward.‚Äù
Due to the probable negative implications for the global cryptocurrency community, hopefully the interpretation of bill S.1241 in this article is proven incorrect; however, at this point, it seems fairly clear (at least to me, the author) that this is the intent behind the bill. If this is indeed the case, it will be the most recent attack on a growing list of State-backed attacks against the crypto-community.

Furthermore, from the noticeable lack of references made to digital currencies during the hearing, it would appear this bill is yet another underhanded attempt of the US Government to further erode global freedoms and civil liberties, which markedly began with the introduction of the Patriot Act, shortly after the 9/11 attacks.

As Tone Vayes mentioned, it would have been nice if Andreas Antonopoulos was there to impart some of the wisdom he shared with the Canadian Senate, on October 8, 2014.

Tone Vayes‚Äô summation*: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs bad‚Ä¶I think it‚Äôs gonna end in a very confrontational way between Bitcoin‚Äîeven Bitcoin holders and users‚Äîand the US Government.‚Äù

Jimmy Song‚Äôs summation*: ‚ÄúYeah, the nice thing about laws is they take a long time‚Ä¶‚Äù

Indeed it will be ‚Äúvery, very interesting to see what goes forward.‚Äù If this bill passes, how many of you future criminals out there are still set on hodling?

*to be fair, neither had yet watched the entire hearing.

Don't invest recklessly,7gi55s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7gi55s/dont_invest_recklessly/,"I posted about this [just a few months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6jrl5o/unrealistic_volatility_expectations/), but I feel that it's necessary to repeat. The Bitcoin price is on an unbelievably ridiculous upswing which is rather likely to be a bubble. If you're trying to get rich quick by dumping your retirement funds into BTC at $10k, then your ""investment strategy"" is not much better than someone betting everything on a game of roulette. High-risk-high-reward investing is not *necessarily* bad, but you have to seriously look at your thought process to make sure that you're not:

* Being blinded by dreams of getting rich quickly, similarly to people who dump money on very-negative-EV lottery tickets.
* Getting wrapped up in ""HODL"" memes, reddit comments, and other groupthink, which is sometimes fun, **but absolutely the last appropriate source of investment advice**.
* Acting based on panic thinking like, ""OMG the price is going to $1 million and I will *miss my chance forever* if I don't buy *right now*"" or ""OMG the price is going to $0.01 and I will *miss my chance forever* to retain some value if I don't sell *right now*"".
* Investing more than you can afford to lose. **Bitcoin is HIGHLY, HIGHLY speculative**. No investment advisor would tell you to put all of your life savings into MSFT or whatever, and MSFT has a market cap 4x larger than Bitcoin. Although I *believe* that it is very unlikely, there are several ways in which the value could drop precipitously, even to zero. For example, there is *no mathematical proof* that the cryptographic algorithms used in Bitcoin are actually secure -- they are merely *believed* to be secure because nobody has been able to break them after many years of intense scrutiny. (I'm not here recommending ""diversifying"" into altcoins -- altcoins are almost all complete trash, and price-wise they follow BTC but with even more volatility, so they're not really useful for diversification.)

It is entirely possible that the massive price increase of the last year is based on lasting fundamentals. In addition to things like the fairly recent subsidy halving, the defeat of B2X, etc., the world fiat-based economy is in many ways on very shaky ground, and getting worse all the time. There are many good reasons why BTC should have a larger market cap than every fiat currency combined. It's even possible that the price will increase quite a bit more from now. But for goodness sake, don't think that Bitcoin is the first-ever infinite-money generator that will continue to rise exponentially forever (in real terms). I can nearly guarantee that **there will be a large and long-lasting crash/downturn at some point**. Maybe it will be $10k to $5k, maybe it will be $50k to $30k, who knows. But if you're thinking for example that the current $5k+ price range is *absolutely secure* after only existing for a few months, then you're traveling blind through very dangerous territory.

Some points to consider:

* Buying near the ATH is very risky, and while it *can* be correct/profitable, it puts you on the wrong footing. You need to buy *low* and sell *high* to make money.
* On 2013-11-29 (exactly 4 years ago) the peak ATH hit $1163, and then fell to $152 by 2015-01-13. That's a drop of 86.9%. Imagine this happens again: The price drops sharply to $2000 or something and then just continuously decreases down to a low of $1,432 (an 86.9% reduction from today's ATH) over the course of a *whole year*. I'm not saying that this *will* happen, but it's happened once and it *can* happen again. **Could you survive this?**
* Bitcoin is experimental, and it is probably imprudent for someone who is not a true believer in the *soul* of Bitcoin to invest a lot into it. For example, I personally wouldn't invest more than a few percent of my total assets into ETH even if I felt very confident that it would rise in price because I simply don't believe in its philosophy or long-term value.
* To reduce risk, it is frequently recommended to allocate assets by percentage, and rebalance upon large price movements. Eg. If you previously decided that you want to allocate 50% of your wealth in BTC (because you are a super big true believer), but BTC is now 90% of your wealth because the price increased so much, it may generally be advisable to start selling to rebalance your BTC allocation back down to 50%. I'm not saying that it is always absolutely wrong to have 90% of your assets in BTC or whatever, but it should be because you are intentionally *choosing* to do so, not because the price got away from you and you never really considered that you now have 90% of your wealth riding on one thing.
* Avoid panic buys and panic sells. Dollar-cost-averaging over a long period of time is often a good strategy.
* Nothing rises in real value to infinity. That's impossible. It is possible that 1 BTC could someday be worth infinite *dollars*, but that just means that dollars are worthless in that hypothetical scenario. BTC probably does have plenty of room to grow in real value before it completely takes over the world, but keep in mind that there *is* a ceiling.
* If BTC were to reach values like $100k-$250k, that'd probably cause/imply that the prevailing economic regime has completely fallen apart. At some point in that price area, people around the world would probably lose substantial faith in fiat currencies. A good result, but ask yourself: do you expect the prevailing economic regime to *go down easily*?

"Guys, I am out",7fvoxh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7fvoxh/guys_i_am_out/,"**So I sold the last of my 22ish BTC yesterday.**

I first got in around September of 2013 when the price was $130. I later set up a weekly buy on Coinbase buying the majority of my coins between $200 to $400. My original goal back then was to accumulate 21 BTC and be in the million club. I turned it off in 2015 once I was well over 21 coins. Of course looking back I wish I had never turned it off.

**So why did I sell?** The value is now enough that I can pay my capital gains and still have enough to pay off my house leaving me completely debt free. I found myself constantly stressing over the fact I was storing close to 200K and I also fully expect a pull back at some point soon. Once my house is paid off I will most likely start buying back in again using money that would have been going towards a house payment.

**Things I learned**  
**Test your recovery process.** If you have a hardware wallet (and you should) send a small amount of crypto to it then wipe it and reload it using your seed. This made me much more confident using the wallet once I had done this and knew that recovery was pretty simple. Also use a passphrase, but make sure it is one you will never forget.

**Store your seed securely.** I used a metal stamp to punch my seed into a ¬º inch steel plate. After that I dipped it in plastisol so it cannot be read and stored it in my safe with a description written on the outside. I also had another copy of the seed stored behind a picture at a trusted family member‚Äôs house just in case.

**Sending a BTC transaction for tens of thousands of dollars is extremely stressful.** I first moved my coins from Coinbase to a hardware wallet before the BCH fork (yes, I was stupid and stored them on an exchange, although I did use their cold storage feature so there was a waiting period before they could be moved if my account was compromised). It was a long 15 minutes before the transaction showed up on the blockchain (I think Coinbase batches transactions up before sending) so I was freaking out that I had done something wrong and all my coins were gone. I wanted to save on transaction fees, but I should have moved them in smaller increments.

**Weekly buys and dollar cost averaging is the way to buy.** I never had to think about the weekly buy so it was worth the small amount I paid for fees. Over time I was able to build a substantial sum.

**It takes a long time to get out due to limits.** I was limited to 10K withdrawal per day so it is taking a while to transition to fiat. I applied for an increase but it was denied for some reason. I am pretty happy with Coinbase, but they are obviously dealing with growing pains. After withdrawing around 50K they quit letting me withdraw and said I needed to do some more verification. I tried uploading my license but the verification kept failing with a blank error message. I submitted a support ticket and heard nothing for several days. I finally remembered that they had recently added phone support so found the number and called. I only had to wait about 10 minutes until I talked to someone and they were very helpful. It turns out I was supposed to be prompted to use a web cam to take a selfie after uploading my license. Once I found that out I did it on my laptop that has a camera and was verified within 5 minutes. I had no problems with withdrawals after that.

**Capital gains suck.** I took all the risk of buying into crypto yet I am going to be on the hook for close to 30K to the government for my long term gains. There is no way I am fucking around with the IRS though, so I will happily pay them. I still have some other crypto and will most likely start buying back in again in a few months. In a few years when I retire I will most likely try to live off of 37.5K income per year from selling crypto so I do not have to pay those capital gains. After a few years of that I will dip into my traditional retirement accounts. I still need to find out if I need to pay an estimated tax payment this quarter to avoid a penalty for not having enough taken out of my paycheck to cover my taxes for the year.

My hat is off to those that are still hodling. It has already gone up quite a bit since I sold. I might look back at selling and kick myself in the future, but right now the thought of being debt free is pretty liberating. 
**It has been one fucking hell of a ride and I will be back on the coaster with the rest of you soon!**

The god damn ""i-told-ya-so"" from John. ""I have no idea how stocks or anything like that work but i know bullshit when i see it. I can't believe people were dumb enough to buy fake money.""

Yea ok mate, if i need a status update on that box of donuts in the break room, you're my go-to guy. other than that? shut up and go back to being shit at your job.

Then you've got Becky, flapping her useless mouth in the background who ""knew"" bitcoin was a scam when her boyfriend's Sister's cousin told her that the ""bitcoin inventor guy"" posted on his website that he was selling all his bitcoin.

""Money can't just be numbers on screens, that's not how money works. it has to be something you can hold as well! With all this net neutrality stuff going on you'd be crazy to invest in money that they can just shut down with the flick of a switch!""

Becky, last week i heard you ask the IT guy if you needed two mice plugged in to your computer if you want to use two screens at once and now you have a working knowledge of both the monetary system, crypto currencies AND the internet?! that's very impressive.

I have no idea why this is annoying me so much, I just found the need to rant while waiting for a meeting to start.

Edit: people seem to have come to some weird conclusions that i've been doing nothing but come to work and try sell crypto to the entire office. the ""i told ya so"" isn't directed at me or anyone in particular, it's just general chatter around the office. i'm not printing out weekly bitcoin news letters to put on peoples desks or waiting by their car at night to ask why they haven't bought BTC.

Try not to jump to conclusions based on a semi-satirical piece of information.

Farewell from the Pineapple Fund,8ieffr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ieffr/farewell_from_the_pineapple_fund/,"Hi everyone,

It's been five months, and having just made my last PF donation to the Internet Archive, I figure it might be a good time to say farewell.

I just want to thank everyone for supporting [this project](https://pineapplefund.org/). Thank you for all the charity suggestions, many of which were funded. Thank you for all the positive messages and love sent my way. And also, thank you, the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency community, for turning a Sourceforge project into a $0.5T industry.

I kind of miss the old times when bitcoin was a small community, and you could count the number of 'altcoins' with one hand. Finding someone else who even *knows* about bitcoin was incredibly rare, and exchanges were semi-automated or running on PHP.

Every development since then makes Bitcoin stronger and better at solving the problems of the existing financial and monetary system. It's created a new generation of crypto early adopters, cypherpunks or technologists using cryptography to change the world; and now having the power and responsibility of capital.

5104 BTC was turned into $55 million for charities, from providing clean water, [open mapping](https://blog.openstreetmap.org/2018/01/11/donation-from-pineapple-fund/), to clinical trials of [MDMA as treatment for PTSD](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/01/us/ecstasy-molly-ptsd-mdma.html). 

Thanks for following along with this experiment. I'm going to say goodbye now, but maybe there's room for dessert in a few years.

If you're ever blessed with crypto fortune, consider supporting what you aspire our world to be. :)

"üçç $4mil will fund MDMA trials for PTSD; marked 'Breakthrough Therapy' by FDA. Pineapple Fund is matching MAPS donations 1:1. Reddit, let's make history by crowdfunding an incredible treatment for PTSD, in bitcoin!",7pg1rh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7pg1rh/4mil_will_fund_mdma_trials_for_ptsd_marked/,"Hi /r/Bitcoin!

You might've heard of PTSD. It's a debilitating illness usually affecting people who are _already_ victims, like sexual assault survivors who still suffer and are tormented every day since. Not only do they experience traumatic flashbacks, even sleep is no relief thanks to serious nightmares. It is life threatening. 

Existing treatment for PTSD aren't great. Therapy can be helpful, but they're often not enough, especially for severe PTSD. There are only two drugs approved by the FDA: SSRIs like Zoloft and Paxil. Those drugs must be taken continuously, and can cause serious side effects. Mania, seizures, inability to orgasm, and suicide are known side effects.

In 1986, a nonprofit named MAPS was started to develop legal contexts for beneficial uses of psychedelics and marijuana. 31 years later, MAPS has found its most promising candidate yet: MDMA-assisted psychotherapy as a treatment for PTSD. 

# The numbers: 68% (MDMA) versus 25% (placebo)

They've already conducted Phase 2 studies in the US, Canada, Israel, and Switzerland. After a comprehensive therapeutic process involving preparatory sessions, MDMA-assisted therapy sessions, and non-drug therapy sessions, **61% no longer met the criteria for PTSD**. This improved to **68%** after a year. Of those who met the criteria, many experienced significant reductions in symptoms. This is compared to only 25% for the placebo group, who received all the therapy, but with a sugar pill instead of MDMA.

For most people, the benefits are lasting. MAPS conducted one long-term outcome study, evaluating patients ~3.5 years after the last MDMA-assisted sessions. Average benefits even increased slightly over time.

> ""The MDMA sessions were the first time I'd ever felt love for myself. It was the first time I'd ever felt happy. I hugged my therapist and said 'Thank you.'""

After MAPS' studies, the FDA granted ['Breakthrough Therapy Designation'](https://www.maps.org/news/media/6786-press-release-fda-grants-breakthrough-therapy-designation-for-mdma-assisted-psychotherapy-for-ptsd,-agrees-on-special-protocol-assessment-for-phase-3-trials) to MDMA-assisted psychotherapy.

Now they need to conduct Phase 3 trials, which are far costlier due to requirements for an increased sample size, groups, etc, even through the stage with highest failure rates (Phase 2) is already over. MAPS has achieved the extra-ordinary journey of bringing MDMA-assisted psychotherapy all the way to Phase 3; a drug that pharmas will never touch because it will disrupt their recurring revenue streams of SSRIs.

# Phase 3

Phase 3 will cost about $25 million. They've raised $17 million already ($1 mil from PF included), and need another $8 million to get to the finish line. 

I have never donated to MAPS (or even heard of them) before starting the Pineapple Fund. PF donated $1 million, and that inspired another anonymous donator to **give another $1 million** in bitcoin. To whoever you are, you're amazing, and you are inspiring. <3

**I believe we, the cryptocurrency community, can fully fund Phase 3 trials**. Prescription MDMA could be a gift to this world from the bitcoin community.

If the trial succeeds, it could be approved as early as 2021. MAPS has created a public benefit corporation, fully owned by the non-profit, that would sell MDMA post-approval. This is a scalable and **financially sustainable** structure that could kickstart a renaissance in research into the therapeutic applications of many different psychedelics.

**Pineapple Fund will double the value of every donation to MAPS** from today until March 10th, up to $4 million. 

You can donate with bitcoin. It's like donating bitcoin for $30,000 each!

http://www.maps.org/donate-redirect/cryptocurrency

You can also donate with legacy payment systems like [credit cards or PayPal](https://store.maps.org/np/clients/maps/donation.jsp?campaign=103), and PF will also match that donation.

Your donations are tax deductible (if you're a US taxpayer), and you don't even have to pay capital gains tax. Ask for a receipt if so.

Let's make MDMA medicine a reality, and give the gift of an enjoyable life to those suffering from PTSD. If you believe that psychedelic drugs can have incredible therapeutic potential, then I believe this is one of the highest impact projects today.

And let's do it with cryptocurrency :)",1515624786.0,545,PineappleFund,1,btc,1

How to transfer Bitcoin from Coinbase for free!,7imq35,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7imq35/how_to_transfer_bitcoin_from_coinbase_for_free/,"I see many people are upset about Coinbase and their insane transfer fees so I thought I would make a simple instruction about how to transfer Bitcoin outta Coinbase for free. Lets get to it!

1. Go to GDAX.com and log in with your Coinbase account. GDAX is owned by Coinbase, and it‚Äôs their platform for more technical people. 

2. After you logged in, verify your account if necessary. 

3. Press the ‚Äúdeposit‚Äù button and then deposit your Bitcoin from your Coinbase wallet. It‚Äôs free and takes only seconds. 

4. Press the ‚Äúwithdraw‚Äù button, then open the ‚ÄúBTC address‚Äù tab and put the address you wish to send your bitcoins to in there. 

That‚Äôs it! You have sent your bitcoins to another address and avoided some serious fees.

My brother killed himself because of BTC,7hmjdw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7hmjdw/my_brother_killed_himself_because_of_btc/,"I don't really know where to post this but I feel like I need to vent.

Do not take this as criticism of Bitcoin, blockchain technology, or cryptocurrency users & developers, it's not.

There are probably other factors that led to my brother's suicide, but he had been beating himself up over Bitcoin for the past several years to the point where he seemed constantly depressed over it and gradually became a shadow of his former happy self.

He claimed to have owned 15,000 at one point, which may have been an exaggeration. But I know for a fact that at some point around October-November 2012 he did have at least 6,000 BTC which he showed me in his wallets. He was so enthusiastic about Bitcoin and how cryptocurrencies would revolutionize the financial world. For awhile he was annoying the fuck out of our relatives about how it would make them millionaires.

I'm not sure exactly what happened to his BTC. Sometime in 2013 he claimed to have lost most of them in a hack and sold the remainder too early. He very well may have sold them all too early, but who knows.

 As the price took off in late 2013-early 2014 you could tell he was distraught over it and became increasingly withdrawn from family and friends. Whenever I did manage to contact him he would sometimes end up ranting about how badly he had fucked up and how he would never have a chance to be rich again.

As the price climbed up to 10k over the past several months it became even more difficult to make contact with him, he just wouldn't reply to me or my parents calls and texts. A couple weeks ago my parents flew out to see my brother and found him dead by suicide with no note. He was 29 with 50 years of life ahead of him.

Other than obvious grief I don't really know how to feel about this. If I had missed out on $50M I might have killed myself too. I can't imagine what my brother must have been feeling these past several years knowing he missed his best & easiest shot at the wealthy life he had always fantasized about. Bitcoin totally fucked up his mindset to the point where you couldn't talk about anything related to investing, money or finances without him storming off or crying.

If there's any more of you in a similar situation feel free to PM me. Please try to recognize there are endless economic opportunities in life and 1 mistake doesn't define your future. There are family and friends who care about you and will listen.",1512469378.0,1942,barking_bonerz,1,btc,1

"***** WARNING ****** DO NOT SEND ANY (LARGE) SUMS TO COINBASE. $40,000 wire transfer missing since 12/18 with ZERO response",7rfwec,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7rfwec/warning_do_not_send_any_large_sums_to_coinbase/,"The question is- why would you ever trust this company?  How do you not reach out to a customer who trusted you with this amount of money?  Is this who you want to be dealing with if/ when the shit really hits the fan in the cryptocurrency space ?   It is a total sham(e), I would have absolutely been a customer, and likely an active one long term.  For all those who have had positive experiences with Coinbase- that's great, but don't assume it will not happen to you at some point, especially when liquidity goes to hell after a crash.  If they can't help a newer customer willing to put in a large amount of funds, why will they help those who put in less. No, I did not deposit this amount without depositing a smaller amount first, which went through, so assumed the systems were fine, and hey worst case the wire is rejected ....  WRONG.  Don't assume it won't happen to you!!  Yes I filed a CFPB and state Financial Institutions complaint.  Yes I called a zillion times.  Yes I did everything they instructed on their ""customer support"" site. Never in my wildest dreams did I think this could happen in this country.  This company has reared its ugly face as a total fraud and/or perhaps a total Ponzi scheme.  How in the world do you return other wires from 5 days ago before addressing ones from more than a month ago, never mind the amount!  Let this be a warning to you all, I would not wish this on ANYONE.  

ADDENDUM: I attempted to transfer to my GDAX account, but the wire goes through the associated Coinbase account, and shows up as a Coinbase deposit (had transferred funds before), hence the references to Coinbase.

** UPDATE **:  I received an email today, Day #33, from GDAX support notifying me that they reviewed the case, and that they will re-send the funds back to the originating account.   
If they follow through, it will be confirmation that it truly is a manpower issue with Coinbase/ GDAX, and should be very encouraging to all with funds transfer problems.   I will update this post when/if funds are actually received back.

** UPDATE**:  Day #37- No funds received.  Received the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau response back today, Coinbase stated the following: 

""Company's Response
Hello Mr. ###, I am sorry for the recent troubles with your wire transfer and also the delay of an agent getting back to you. An agent was able to reach out to you via case ### regarding your issue. There was an issue processing the return of your wire, but another team looked into it and had the funds sent back to your bank. If you have not seen the funds or have any other questions, please feel free to reach out to above mentioned case and we can look into the matter further. Again, I am sorry for the recent issues with your wire transfer.""

Again, no funds have been received, and all they did is assign another case # without a Point of contact.  ",1516365492.0,1037,suasponte26,1,btc,1

Just a quick reminder why Bitcoin was invented in the first place. This used to be preaching to the choir. But these days I am not so sure.,6rr6ph,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6rr6ph/just_a_quick_reminder_why_bitcoin_was_invented_in/,"*	People used to pay each other in gold and silver. Difficult to transport. Difficult to divide.
*	Paper money was invented. A claim to gold in a bank vault. Easier to transport and divide.
*	Banks gave out more paper money than they had gold in the vault. They ran ‚Äúfractional reserves‚Äù. A real money maker. But every now and then, banks collapsed because of runs on the bank.
*	Central banking was invented. Central banks would be lenders of last resort. Runs on the bank were thus mitigated by banks guaranteeing each other‚Äôs deposits through a central bank. The risk of a bank run was not lowered. Its frequency was diminished and its impact was increased. After all, banks remained basically insolvent in this fractional reserve scheme.
*	Banks would still get in trouble. But now, if one bank got in sufficient trouble, they would all be in trouble at the same time. Governments would have to step in to save them. 
*	All ties between the financial system and gold were severed in 1971 when Nixon decided that the USD would no longer be exchangeable for a fixed amount of gold. This exacerbated the problem, because there was now effectively no limit anymore on the amount of paper money that banks could create. 
*	From this moment on, all money was created as credit. Money ceased to be supported by an asset. When you take out a loan, money is created and lent to you. Banks expect this freshly minted money to be returned to them with interest. Sure, banks need to keep adequate reserves. But these reserves basically consist of the same credit-based money. And reserves are much lower than the loans they make. 
*	This led to an explosion in the money supply. The Federal Reserve stopped reporting M3 in 2006. But the ECB currently reports a yearly increase in the supply of the euro of about 5%.
*	This leads to a yearly increase in prices. The price increase is somewhat lower than the increase in the money supply. This is because of increased productivity. Society gets better at producing stuff cheaper all the time. So, in absence of money creation you would expect prices to drop every year. That they don‚Äôt is the effect of money creation.
*	What remains is an inflation rate in the 2% range.
*	Banks have discovered that they can siphon off all the productivity increase + 2% every year, without people complaining too much. They accomplish this currently by increasing the money supply by 5% per year, getting this money returned to them at an interest.
*	Apart from this insidious tax on society, banks take society hostage every couple of years. In case of a financial crisis, banks need bailouts or the system will collapse.
*	Apart from these problems, banks and governments are now striving to do away with cash. This would mean that no two free men would be able to exchange money without intermediation by a bank. If you believe that to transact with others is a fundamental right, this should scare you.
*	The absence of sound money was at the root of the problem. We were force-fed paper money because there were no good alternatives. Gold and silver remain difficult to use.
*	When it was tried to launch a private currency backed by precious metals (Liberty dollar), this initiative was shut down because it undermined the U.S. currency system. Apparently, a currency alternative could only thrive if ‚Äúnobody‚Äù launched it and if they was no central point of failure. 
*	What was needed was a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. This was what Satoshi Nakamoto described in 2008. It was a response to all the problems described above. That is why he labeled the genesis block with the text: ‚Äú03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.‚Äù. Bitcoin was meant to be an alternative to our current financial system.

So, if you find yourself religiously checking some cryptocurrency‚Äôs price, or bogged down in discussions about the ‚Äúone true bitcoin‚Äù, or constantly asking what currency to buy, please at least remember that we have bigger fish to fry.

We are here to fix the financial system.

10 things I wish someone had told me when I was learning to trade crypto,7iug4i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iug4i/10_things_i_wish_someone_had_told_me_when_i_was/,"While I consider myself an amateur trader and a small-scale investor, over the 2+ years of trading crypto I've learned some things I'd like to share with you all, but mostly with those who are making their first steps into the uncharted cryptoland. 

1. Just as with anything else in life, **trading cryptocurrencies is context dependent**. That means you should remain a healthy sceptic about general truths, universal rules and things that ""everyone knows"". Consider the famous ""buy low sell high"" dictum. The definition of high and low is subjective in most cases since it depends on your timescale, goals and trading strategy. If you‚Äôre a hodler, as are many of the fellow redditors here, your high and low will differ dramatically compared to the day trader's.

2. It is for the same reason that **bulls and bears don't really matter**. Whether you're 'bullish' or 'bearish' depends on your strategy and timescale. Consider this: to someone hodling BTC since 2013 a dip here or there (even a prolonged one) makes little difference because the price of BTC over the time continues to grow monstrously ‚Äì you can call it one long-term bull market.

3. At some point, you'll bump (or you already have) into something that is called 'technical analysis'. Let me save you some time (and money, probably) by telling you this: **technical analysis is neither technical, nor is it very analytical**. While many traders regard TA to be a scientific way (supposedly based on mathematics) to read and predict the market moves, TA has little to do with any formal science. Differently from the surrounding physical world, we are not aware of any physical laws that govern our human behavior, including markets. If it was possible to mathematically calculate and with certainty predict market moves, the big buck guys in Wall Street would have already done it. Think about the major financial crises for a moment ‚Äì just like the Spanish Inquisition, nobody (well, almost nobody) ever expected one. Does it mean TA ‚Äì  trends, chart patterns, MACD, RSI, Elliot wave count, etc. ‚Äì is a complete rubbish? I wouldn't go as far as to claim that. It is somewhat helpful ‚Äì if only a little, TA still gives you a feel of the current market mood. TA also does one other thing pretty accurately: it graphically represents historic data of human behavior in the financial markets. Surely you can benefit from that? Or do you? This brings me to another point...

4. **Beware of historical analogies and 'I knew it all along' thing**. As humans, we are prone to hindsight bias, a tendency, after an event has occurred, to see it as having been easily predictable. We are all blinded by hindsight bias because our brain looks for simplistic linear link between cause and effect. This way when an unexpected event happens, the brain uses the knew-it-all-along mode to cope with cognitive dissonance and make sense of the surrounding world. While trading hindsight bias harms you in two ways: a) it drains you psychologically for not making 'the right' decisions in the past, and by luring you into oversimplified historic analogies, b) it creates a false sense of investment security at the present time. Just look at everyone complaining they've sold their BTC at the worst possible time (as a matter of fact, I am no different ‚Äì I still autodestructively loathe my decision to liquidate a large portion of my BTC portfolio after the BTC price hiked to 8k). It is also very tempting to think you wouldn't miss 'the next bitcoin'. The problem is, though, that it is incredibly difficult if at all possible to spot such an opportunity. You have to be either lucky or extremely well informed (and lucky) to capitalize early on such opportunity. In reality, it's very difficult to differentiate between useless information (noise) and something that truly matters (signal). Which brings me yet to another point...

5. **Stop being a news junkie and start filtering what you read/hear/see**. If you don't, at some point in time the quantity of consumed news will start to impact your decisions and it will begin to negatively correlate with the net gain of your investment portfolio. Instead of reading news nonstop, better educate yourself ‚Äì dive deep into the market fundamentals and the technology you're dealing with. This way it will be easier for you to spot new lucrative investment opportunities when the time comes.

6. **Accept the fact that idiots also happen to make lots of money and move on**. Multiple times too, if they're lucky ones. However, the net worth of (lucky) idiot doesn't mean you should imitate him and become one. Some two months ago a Dutch father of two young children sold his family's house, bought BTC and other cryptocurrencies, and relocated his family to a rented property. After the recent spike in BTC price the guy's net worth must have increased substantially. So, is he an idiot? Absolutely! It is only a question of time before he ruins his own and his family's life with some incredibly reckless financial decision.

7. **Try to understand the motives governing your decisions and act (or don't act) accordingly**. If your actions are about to be driven by extreme emotions such as fear, panic or excitement ‚Äì stop immediately and reevaluate the situation. Otherwise you'll end up belonging to the FOMO buyer/panic seller club aka the money losers. If you want to stay on the earning side long term, you must keep your head cool and think clearly.

8. **Day trading is probably not for you**. Consider this: evidence in neuroscience research shows that we are a loss-averse species. For this we should thank our stone age ancestors who had barely enough food, shelter and belongings to survive in a very adverse world. Losing even a little of what they had meant their existence was in jeopardy. This explains why contemporary humans prefer avoiding financial loss to making financial gain. Neuroscientists claim that losing money activates the same area of the brain that responds to mortal danger. This is why in order to do day trading you must have A LOT of self-control and balls of steel ‚Äì there are many ups and downs during a single day. It drains you emotionally, you end up being addicted to adrenaline, your fianc√©e hates it, and the hodlers will probably outperform you in the long run anyway.

9. **Volatility is your friend**. Over time BTC volatility makes the coin stronger, not weaker. While wild swings in price makes BTC almost impossible to use as a currency, volatility is good from the financial asset point of view. Traders and investors dealing with BTC get used to huge and sudden price hikes and dips. Unlike for any 'stable' stock of any prominent multinational corporation, even substantial and unexpected shocks will not undermine the confidence in BTC. BTW, best of luck to everyone planning to short BTC. :)

10. **Make small mistakes, learn from them, get wiser, err less**. In your childhood days, you needed the experience of burning your hand with fire so that for the rest of your life you wouldn't need to think about the painful experience. That information is now hardwired in your brain and helps you to avoid getting harmed. If you've just started trading crypto, expect to make mistakes and prepare to learn from them. It's only after you get into FOMO, get panicked big time, take too big a risk, get out too early only to jump in at the worst possible time, ONLY and ONLY then you'll start to improve.

A few thousand bitcoin users from /r/Bitcoin switching to making their next transactions Segwit transactions will help take pressure off the network now, and together we can encourage exchanges/wallets to rapidly deploy Segwit for everyone ASAP. Let's make it happen.


**Exchanges:** Find out if your exchange has deployed Segwit already. If not, politely request that they do so within 30-days or they will lose your business. Sign-up for an account with a Segwit deployed/ready exchange now

**FAQs**

If I'm a HODLer, will it help to send my BTC to a Segwit address now?

- No, just get ready now so that your NEXT transaction will be to a Segwit wallet. 

Can you please tell me how to move my bitcoins to segwit address in Bitcoin core wallet? Does the sender or receiver matter? 

- The Bitcoin core wallet does not yet have a GUI for its Segwit functionality. Download Electrum v3.0.3 to generate a Segwit address.

 via [HowToToken.com](https://howtotoken.com/explained/send-bitcoin-faster-cheaper-segwit-transactions/):

 A transaction between two SegWit addresses is a SegWit transaction. 

 A transaction sent from a SegWit address to a non-SegWit address is a SegWit transaction.

 A transaction sent from a non-SegWit address to a SegWit address is NOT a SegWit transaction. You can send a Segwit Tx if the sending address is a Segwit address.

Is there a hardware wallet that does segwit addresses?

- Yes, Trezor supports Segwit by default. Ledger Nano also has support.

What wallet are you using to ""batch your sends""? And how can I do that?

- Using Electrum, the ""Tools"" menu option: ""Pay to many"".

 Just enter your receive addresses and the amounts for each, and you can send multiple transactions for nearly the price of one.

ARE YOU PART OF THE SOLUTION? News: Unconfirmed TX's @ 174K, more exchanges adding SegWit, Core prioritizes SegWit GUI",7m6zd0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7m6zd0/day_4_i_will_repost_this_guide_daily_until/,"**NOTE** Just a daily repost because original OP [/u/Bastiat](https://www.reddit.com/user/Bastiat) seems to be offline (due to holidays I guess). However, this is quite important as I see much misinformation on which exchanges use segwit or not.    
Please upvote for awareness.

**BACKGROUND**

Subhan Nadeem has pointed out that:

[If every transaction in the Bitcoin network was a SegWit transaction today, blocks would contain up to 8,000 transactions, and the 138,000 unconfirmed transaction backlog would disappear instantly. Transaction fees would be almost non-existent once again](https://hackernoon.com/bitcoin-owners-you-need-to-do-these-two-things-right-now-a73122dd23d4). 

A few thousand bitcoin users from /r/Bitcoin switching to making their next transactions SegWit transactions will help take pressure off the network now, and together we can encourage exchanges/wallets to rapidly deploy SegWit for everyone ASAP. Let's make it happen. You can help by taking one or more of the action steps below. 
___________________

**ACTION STEPS**

1. If your favorite wallet has not yet implemented SegWit, kindly ask them to do so immediately. In the meantime start using a wallet that has already implemented SegWit. 
2. If your favorite exchange has not yet implemented SegWit, try to avoid making any further purchases of bitcoin at that exchange and politely inform them that if they do not enable SegWit within 30-days they will lose your business. Sign-up for an account at a SegWit deployed exchange now and initiate the verification process so you'll be ready to bail
3. Help educate newcomers to bitcoin about the transaction issue, steer them towards SegWit wallets from day one, and encourage them to avoid ever  purchasing bitcoin through non-SegWit ready exchanges that are harming bitcoin

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: The mempool is currently overflowing. If you are a long-term holder and really have no reason to move your bitcoins at this time, wait until the mempool starts to clear and transaction fees go down before moving your bitcoins to a SegWit address or SegWit friendly exchange

__________________________

**SELECTED TOP EXCHANGES BY SEGWIT & BATCHING STATUS**
 
There are 2 different Segwit address formats.  

* p2sh - starting with a ""3...""
* bech32 - starting ""bc1...""

Not many wallets/exchanges support bech32 yet and will claim the address is invalid if you try to send to it. bech32 (""native Segwit"") is a mildly better solution compared to p2sh.

**FAQs**

If I'm a HODLer, will it help to send my BTC to a SegWit address now?

- No, just get ready now so that your NEXT transaction will be to a SegWit wallet. Avoid burdening the network with any unneccessary transactions for now. 

Can you please tell me how to move my bitcoins to SegWit address in Bitcoin core wallet? Does the sender or receiver matter? 

- The Bitcoin core wallet does not yet have a GUI for its SegWit functionality. Download Electrum v3.0.3 to generate a SegWit address.

 A transaction between two SegWit addresses is a SegWit transaction. 

 A transaction sent from a SegWit address to a non-SegWit address is a SegWit transaction.

 A transaction sent from a non-SegWit address to a SegWit address is NOT a SegWit transaction. You can send a SegWit Transaction if the sending address is a SegWit address.

So what address can I send to safely, there is so much confusion?

 - The Core Wallet supports SegWit, but its GUI doesn't. The next update will likely have GUI support built-in
 
Why isn't a large exchange like Coinbase SegWit ready & deployed when much smaller exchanges already are? Why do they default to high fees? Where is the leadership there?

"I'm Mark Karpel√®s, ex-CEO of bankrupt MtGox. Ask me anything.",89o16y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/89o16y/im_mark_karpel√®s_exceo_of_bankrupt_mtgox_ask_me/,"Dear community,

Many of you know or remember me, especially recently since the MtGox bankruptcy has been allegedly linked with Bitcoin price drops in December 2017 to February 2018. Since taking over the most active Bitcoin exchange in 2011, I ran MtGox until filing for civil rehabilitation on February 28th 2014 (which became bankruptcy less than 2 months later) because a large amount of Bitcoins went missing. Since then, four years have passed, and MtGox is still in bankruptcy today. I‚Äôve been arrested, released under bail after a little less than one year, and am now trying to assist MtGox getting into civil rehabilitation.

I did my best trying to grow the ecosystem by running the biggest exchange at the time. It had big problems but still managed to hang in there. For a while. A quite long while, even, while the rest of the ecosystem caught up. At the end of the day, the methods I chose to try to get MtGox out of its trouble ended up being insufficient, insufficiently executed, or plain wrong.

I know I didn't handle the last, stressful days of the outdrawn and painful Gox collapse very well. I can only be humble about that in hindsight. Once again, I‚Äôm sorry.

Japanese bankruptcy law has a particularly nasty outcome here, and I want to address this up front. As creditors claims were registered, those claims were registered in the valuation of Japanese Yen on the bankruptcy date. That's the only way Japanese bankruptcy law can work (most bankruptcy laws around the world operate this way for that matter). This means that the claims can be paid back in full, and there will still be over 160,000 bitcoin and bitcoin cash in assets in the Gox estate. The way bankruptcy law works is that if there are any assets remaining after the creditors have been paid in full, then those assets are distributed to shareholders as part of the liquidation.

That's the only way any bankruptcy law can reasonably work. And yet, in this case, it produces an egregiously distasteful outcome in that the shareholders of MtGox would walk away with the value of over 160,000 bitcoin as a result of what happened.

I don't want this. I don't want this billion dollars. From day one I never expected to receive anything from this bankruptcy. The fact that today this is a possibility is an aberration and I believe it is my responsibility to make sure it doesn‚Äôt happen. One of the ways to do this would be civil rehabilitation, and as it seems most creditors agree with this, I am doing my best to help make it happen. I do not want to become instantly rich. I do not ask for forgiveness. I just want to see this end as soon as possible with everyone receiving their share of what they had on MtGox so everyone, myself included, can get some closure.

I‚Äôm an engineer at heart. I want to build things. I like seeing what I build being useful, and people being happy using what I build. My drive, from day one, has been to push the limits of what is technically possible, and this is the main reason I liked and have been involved with Bitcoin in the first place. When I took over MtGox, I never imagined things would end this way and I am forever sorry for everything that‚Äôs taken place and all the effect it had on everyone involved.

Hopefully, I can make what I‚Äôve learned in this experience useful to the community as a whole, so there can at least be something positive in the end.

Ask me anything you like.

Let me give you a helpful hint..

We're not in a correction until the sweat falling down your neck meets the sweat of your ass crack in a pool on your desk chair while your sitting up at 3am staring at a stamp chart 3 inches from your face trying to convince yourself thats its going to reverse any second now. Your hand shaking like a Parkinson's patient over an oily mouse when suddenly you feel the dire need to take a shit but you vomit in your mouth a little bit instead and before you have time to question how those two bodily functions could possibly be related we've already dropped another 20%.  You've now got a big red dildo candle showing a 60% loss in a matter of minutes staring back at you as price has dipped far below your buy in spot, all the profits you made over the past several weeks, dreams of that new car, that new house disappear in an instant and you cant imagine what possibly could have caused this.

Of course no one has any more of a clue then you do so you immediately start to internalize the struggle.  What starts as a whisper of ""why didn't I just sell"" turns into a rampage scream in the back of your mind, after all its so obvious that this was the top, it's so clear now looking back, of course that was the top how the hell didn't I see that 15 minutes ago?  Meanwhile we're down another 5% and you just can't take it anymore.  Tears are rushing from your eyes, something that looks like dried blood is all over your arm emanating from the spot you didn't realize you were subconsciously digging your fingernail into.  You close your eyes just for a moment but when they reopen you realize you've somehow already logged into your Coinbase account and punched in a sell order.  Thats it.  You sold.  Your devastated, but manage to breathe a small sigh of relief. Well at least i can't lose anymore you say, at least i walked away with something.  Your emotionally and physically exhausted now but you manage to drag yourself across the room, you fall flat on your bed with one final thought passing through your mind before you let the darkness overtake you...""why didn't i just sell the top?""

In the morning you wake to the realization that you slept fully clothed and at an odd enough angle that your neck is surely going to feel exactly as bad if not worse for the rest of the day.  The events of the previous night come back to you in a flurry of blurred emotions and while you almost can't bring yourself to check the price you just have to know.  How much lower did it go? After all, there is still a glimmer of a hope, you think well, perhaps it isn't all bad, perhaps I can buy back in a bit lower and make the losses back in the long term.  You begrudgingly open a chart and whatever small amount of hope that remained escapes your lungs before the sigh hits your lips.  Price has fully recovered, it's actually trading up 10% from yesterdays highs...

Thats a correction.

The coronavirus shutdown is hammering supply and demand across the globe. That has forced the real economy into a sharp recession and triggered a rolling financial crisis. Below is a primer on one key piece of this mess: the crisis in corporate debt markets. This branch of finance is vitally important because even healthy companies often need access to credit. If they do not get it, they go under.

In 2008, the vector of crisis ran from mortgage-backed securities to the rest of the financial sector and then to the real economy. This time, the real economy is being hit directly, and the damage is reverberating back into financial markets.  The failing markets, in feedback-loop fashion, further threaten the real economy as corporations find it harder to borrow. As the corporate debt markets sour, major companies will go bankrupt. Unemployment is skyrocketing. Some analysts expect the economy to contract by an annualized rate of 30 percent during the second quarter of 2020.

Already, US financial markets are on public life support. The Federal Reserve has committed to unlimited purchases of all sorts of assets: US Treasuries, mortgage-backed securities, car loans, municipal debts, and, in a historic step, both short term and long-term corporate debt. But the crisis will require more than a financial rescue.

The key political question now is: What sort of controls will come with the state intervention? Corporate greed and self-dealing need to be checked not merely in the name of fairness but also to make sure public bailout money is actually invested in the real economy rather than just gambled away, as it was after the 2008 crash and rescue.

###The Rise of Corporate Debt

Since 2008, household debt levels have actually declined and are now lower than they were going into the last crash. But not corporate debt. Measured as a firm‚Äôs ‚Äúnet debt‚Äù compared to its EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization), corporate debt has doubled since the last crash. In 2009, the average American company owed $2 of debt for every $1 in earnings. Today, the average firm carries net debt to EBITDA of 3 to 1, and many firms ‚Äî like Ford Motor, CarMax, Harley-Davidson, and General Motors ‚Äî carry ratios ranging from 8 to 1, to as high as 15 to 1. Boeing, a special case because of its 737 MAX crisis, carries a ratio of 37 to 1.

Over the last two decades, corporate America‚Äôs credit rating has collapsed. In the early ‚Äô90s, more than sixty companies held AAA credit ratings. Today, only two US firms are AAA rated: Johnson & Johnson and Microsoft. In 2001, fewer than one in five ‚Äúinvestment-grade‚Äù firms were rated BBB. Today half of all investment-grade corporate debt belongs to firms rated ‚Äútriple-B‚Äù (BBB) or lower. A third of those firms are rated triple-B minus (BBB-), one notch away from speculative or ‚Äújunk‚Äù status.

Already many triple-B-rated corporate bonds are trading on secondary markets at unusually low prices and high yields, often above 5 percent; that means even ‚Äúinvestment grade‚Äù bonds are being treated as junk. Soon many triple-B-rated corporations will be formally downgraded to junk. That will drive up their borrowing costs and restrict their access to credit. Even healthy companies often need access to ready credit. If they do not get it, they go under.

The rating agency Moody‚Äôs estimates the default rate for ‚Äúspeculative-grade‚Äù debt ‚Äî companies with ratings lower than Baa from Moody‚Äôs Investors Service, or a rating lower than BBB from Standard & Poor‚Äôs ‚Äî might reach 10 percent this year, up from 2.3 percent last year. The consequences of all this will reverberate throughout the wider economy, deepening and extending the recession.

Total global corporate debt, including bonds and loans, is approximately $66 trillion; more than double what it was a decade ago. For comparison, the combined gross national product of all economies was estimated at $80.27 trillion in 2017. About a quarter of that is the US economy.

###What They Did With the Money

After the 2008 crash, the world‚Äôs central banks, with the US Federal Reserve in the lead, spent the next decade pushing money into the financial markets by way of super-low interest rates and the direct public purchase of financial assets from the private sector via quantitative easing (QE).

The cheap credit encouraged lots of corporate borrowing in the form of loans from banks and massive issuance of corporate bonds. Unlike loans, which can be routinely extended, or sometimes abruptly terminated, or have interest rates that float up and down, corporate bonds are debt instruments issued by a company committing to repay borrowed money on a specified schedule at a specified, usually fixed, rate of interest.

Corporations have been borrowing for a variety of reasons that range from shrewd arbitrage to stupid and reckless asset stripping. For a struggling and unprofitable company, for example JCPenney, debt can be a lifeline. For a profitable firm, borrowing money can be a way to raise capital without diluting existing shareholders‚Äô claim on the company‚Äôs profits, which would happen if the firm issued stock.

Even some profitable firms with piles of cash borrowed rather than spend their cash, in part for the firepower effect: letting other competitors and market entrants know that the firm has enough money on hand to buy out any threatening start-ups, and showing the world the firm is ready to ride out any economic crisis.

Some firms used their borrowed money to buy other firms. This helped fuel a post-2008 wave of mergers and acquisitions (M&As). Deloitte reported ‚Äúmore than $10 trillion in [M&A] domestic transactions since 2013.‚Äù Targeted companies borrowed to stockpile cash as a defense against such takeovers.

Firms also borrowed to fund CEO compensation, distributions to investors via dividends, and stock buybacks. Companies buy back their own stock so as to boost its price. A rising stock price is useful in many ways: it can keep away hostile raiders by making a targeted company too expensive to take over, but it can also draw in friendly suitors because (with some creative accounting) a rising stock value can make a weak firm appear more profitable. Corporate executives like a rising stock price because compensation packages are both tied to stock performance and almost always include some payment in company stock, so the higher the stock price, the higher the executives‚Äô payout.

Sometimes, firms even invested their borrowed money in actual production. The capital-intensive oil and gas industry did that, but as we explain below, it still faces a crisis, perhaps more salient than other sectors.

###Bad Credit as Perverse Incentive

The end result of all the borrowing was declining corporate credit-worthiness: corporate debt soon badly outpaced their earnings growth and cash balances. This led to widespread credit-rating downgrades.

Perversely, lower credit ratings did not slow the borrowing binge, but rather spurred on further lending and borrowing, because as corporate credit ratings slipped, the interest rate that the downgraded firms had to pay on their loans and bonds increased. And, thus, so too did the lenders‚Äô profits.

Corporate debt and stock prices entered into a twisted dialectic, each driving the other. As the stock market continued to inflate over the last decade, it provided the confidence investors required to continue their purchases of risky corporate bonds.

Keep in mind that many of the lending banks and asset funds were actually or essentially borrowing from Uncle Sam at inflation-adjusted rates close to zero, then lending to companies with triple-B and triple-B minus ratings at 5 percent interest. Profits like that meant there were always banks and asset funds eager to lend to debt-burdened corporations.

Investors could directly purchase specific corporations‚Äô bonds, or, as is more often the case, invest in mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that target an array of corporate bonds. High-risk loans were also sliced and diced and repackaged into bundles called ‚Äúcollateralized loan obligations‚Äù (CLOs), a class of securities backed by an underlying portfolio of corporate loans.

According to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, the majority of American CLOs are held by US institutional investors, including insurance companies, mutual funds, and depository institutions. This means that when the debt is unable to be serviced, the pain will be absorbed within the US economy, much of it by the unassuming customers of these financial behemoths.

As was the case with the mortgage-backed securities of the 2008 crash, these funds helped ‚Äúdistribute risk‚Äù and thus gave an appearance of safety. The logic was that owning 1 percent of a hundred different loans would be safer, even if some loans went bad, than owning the entirety of a single debt security. The logic is not entirely wrong. And that is part of the problem: it encouraged yet more lending. As long as the economic forecast was optimistic, there was no reason for the debt spree to let up.

###Zombies and Others

Corporate debt, like much of the economy, is a story of disparities. Not every corporation is burdened by debt. Some firms are actually awash in cash. Microsoft, Berkshire Hathaway, Alphabet Inc, and Apple each sit on more than $100 billion in cash. As a whole, corporate America has been sitting on record amounts of cash in recent years. But at the same time, Morgan Stanley Investment Management estimates that one in six US companies cannot cover even the interest payments on their debts.

At the heart of the problem are ‚Äúleveraged loans‚Äù and so-called zombie firms. Leveraged loans are a type of expensive, high-risk credit extended to already heavily indebted companies. Since the 2008 crash, the leveraged loan market has doubled to $1.2 trillion. Now, leveraged loans in the United States are being re-sold at only 84 cents on the dollar, their lowest price since August 2009. The majority of leveraged loans ‚Äî more than half ‚Äî are in the form of the aforementioned CLOs. In the fourth quarter of 2018, there were $617 billion of CLOs outstanding.

Zombie firms are defined by the Bank for International Settlements as heavily indebted, well-established companies that have failed to be profitable over an extended period and have low expected profitability in the future. In other words, heavily indebted start-ups do not qualify as zombies. The most threatened sectors are energy, automotive, insurance, capital goods (meaning equipment and machinery), telecoms, aerospace and defense, and some parts of retail.

The bull market of rising, often overvalued, stock prices allowed many uncompetitive and unprofitable companies to appear healthy based solely on their stock‚Äôs performance. Even before the markets started to crash on March 9, some analysts were prescient enough to call the market‚Äôs bluff at the beginning of the year.

But in this rapidly developing crisis, firms all across the economy may soon find it impossible to meet their liabilities. With the coronavirus breaking supply chains and forcing massive constrictions in consumer demand, corporate earnings are contracting fast, which in turn will badly hurt corporate debt servicing.

Like a hypertrophied organ rupturing, the putrefaction of unsustainable corporate debt now threatens to create a generalized economic sepsis that will hurt even healthy firms.

###Profiles in Debt

Airlines. The top six major US airlines spent enormous sums to buy back their stock over the last decade. US airlines (as a whole) spent 96 percent of their borrowed money on buying back stock. Now, revenue from flights is plummeting. United Airlines‚Äô bookings have fallen by 70 percent. Back in 2011, American Airlines filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy with $29 billion in liabilities; today, they have over $34 billion in debt. Yields on some of their bonds reached a whopping 12 percent, a particularly distressing sign as interest rates have been slashed by the Fed in an effort to relieve credit markets.

Energy. Even before the effects of coronavirus eviscerated demand for fossil fuels, US energy companies were suffering due to high fixed costs and low energy prices. In the last five years, 208 US energy companies have declared bankruptcy. Energy prices have been pushed down by the fracking revolution, the rise of renewable energy, and oil overproduction due to struggles between large producers like Saudi Arabia, Russia, and the United States.

Now the coronavirus shock is pushing firms over the edge. Occidental Petroleum ‚Äî which has $40 billion in debt, while its market value (the value of all of its stocks combined) is less than $11 billion ‚Äî recently had its debt downgraded to junk.

Energy mutual funds reveal the crisis in the energy sector as a whole. Vanguard Energy Fund, considered one of the top four oil mutual funds, has lost over 41 percent of its value since the beginning of the year. Of course, the biggest oil companies, the ‚ÄúOil Majors‚Äù (such as BP, Exxon Mobil, and Royal Dutch Shell) have enough resources, market power, and government support to survive the crisis. But the effects on the less established firms stretch beyond the energy industry itself.

Lenders. As the oil and gas firms go into crisis, the banks that extended them credit may also face defaults. Loans outstanding to the petroleum sector from regional banks in North America exceed $100 billion. Banks financing oil companies in Texas and Oklahoma saw their share prices drop nearly 30 percent. In oil-dependent states, public budgets will hurt as tax revenues decline sharply.

Retail. A number of important retailers carry net debt to EBITDA ratios that are too high to be sustainable under current conditions. For example, Rite Aid owes $15.80 for every dollar it earns. For JCPenney, the ratio is $8.30 to $1; for Walgreens Boots Alliance, it is $5.80 to $1. Office Depot owes $4.60 compared to every dollar earned.

###Beyond Bailout

Bailing out distressed companies, even taking them under public ownership for a while, may staunch the bleeding. And the bubble can eventually be reinflated with enough effort. But a replay of the 2008 bailout, which involved lots of public money but very little public regulation and planning, will only mean a long slump followed by a bubble for the rich.

The American economy is a sick beast. It needs not only government handouts and ownership ‚Äî which it is getting ‚Äî it also needs planning.

Oil, airlines, and cruise ships ‚Äî these are high-emission industries that, in the face of climate crisis, must be radically transformed or cease to exist. With government ownership and planning, these industries could be unwound and their resources redeployed.

Although COVID-19 set off our current recession, it was the indulgence of the 1 percent built into the 2008 rescue that is responsible for the depth and severity of our current economic crisis. Without guidance, money was poured into the financial system. Not surprisingly, it blossomed alongside the mutually reinforcing dynamic of artificially inflated stock prices and ballooning corporate debt.

Capitulation to the gluttony of financiers is deeply unjust. But it is also unworkable in purely technical terms. Without constraints on greed, there will be another bubble and crash and a longer slump, more suffering, greater inequality, and more social instability. We have to force government to use its legal and financial power to steer the American economy toward more egalitarian, socially rational, and environmentally sustainable purposes. We have to make this bailout work for the majority of us.

#Corporate Socialism: The Government is Bailing Out Investors & Managers Not You


The U.S. government is enacting measures to save the airlines, Boeing, and similarly affected corporations. While we clearly insist that these companies must be saved, there may be ethical, economic, and structural problems associated with the details of the execution. As a matter of fact, if you study the history of bailouts, there will be.



The bailouts of 2008‚Äì9 saved the banks (but mostly the bankers), thanks to the execution by then-treasury secretary Timothy Geithner who fought for bank executives against both Congress and some other members of the Obama administration. Bankers who lost more money than ever earned in the history of banking, received the largest bonus pool in the history of banking less than two years later, in 2010. And, suspiciously, only a few years later, Geithner received a highly paid position in the finance industry.

That was a blatant case of corporate socialism and a reward to an industry whose managers are stopped out by the taxpayer. The asymmetry (moral hazard) and what we call optionality for the bankers can be expressed as follows: heads and the bankers win, tails and the taxpayer loses. Furthermore, this does not count the policy of quantitative easing that went to inflate asset values and increased inequality by benefiting the super rich. Remember that bailouts come with printed money, which effectively deflate the wages of the middle class in relation to asset values such as 
ultra-luxury apartments in New York City.

The Generalized Bob Rubin Trade: Keep the profits, transfer losses to taxpayers. Named after Bob Rubin who pocketed 120 million dollars from Citi but claimed uncertainty and kept past bonuses. This encourages anyone to never be insured for such eventualities since the government will pick up the tab.

####If It‚Äôs Bailed Out, It‚Äôs a Utility

First, we must not conflate airlines as a physical company with the financial structure involved. Nor should we conflate the fate of the employees of the airlines with the unemployment of our fellow citizens, which can be directly compensated rather than indirectly via leftovers of corporate subsidies. We should learn from the Geithner episode that bailing out individuals based on their needs is not the same as bailing out corporations based on our need for them.

Saving an airline, therefore, should not equate to subsidizing their shareholders and highly compensated managers and promote additional moral hazard in society. For the very fact that we are saving airlines indicates their role as utility. And if as such they are necessary for society, then why do their managers have optionality? Are civil servants on a bonus scheme? The same argument must also be made, by extension, against indirectly bailing out the pools of capital, like hedge funds and endless investment strategies, that are so exposed to these assets; they have no honest risk mitigation strategy, other than a trained na√Øve reliance on bailouts or what‚Äôs called in the industry the ‚Äúgovernment put‚Äù.

Second, these corporations are lobbying for bailouts, which they will eventually get thanks to the pressure they can exert on the government via lobby units. But how about the small corner restaurant ? The independent tour guide ? The personal trainer? The massage professional? The barber? The hotdog vendor living from tourists near the Met Museum ? These groups cannot afford lobbyists and will be ignored.

####Buffers Not Debt

Third, as we have been warning since 2006, companies need buffers to face uncertainty ‚Äìnot debt (an inverse buffer), but buffers. Mother nature gave us two kidneys when we only need about a portion of a single one. Why? Because of contingency. We do not need to predict specific adverse events to know that a buffer is a must. Which brings us to the buyback problem. Why should we spend taxpayer money to bailout companies who spent their cash (and often even borrowed to generate that cash) to buy their own stock (so the CEO gets optionality), instead of building a rainy day buffer? Such bailouts punish those who acted conservatively and harms them in the long run, favoring the fool and the rent-seeker.

####Not a Black Swan

Furthermore, some people claim that the pandemic is a ‚ÄúBlack Swan‚Äù, hence something unexpected so not planning for it is excusable. The book they commonly cite is The Black Swan. Had they read that book, they would have known that such a global pandemic is explicitly presented there as a white swan: something that would eventually take place with great certainty. Such acute pandemic is unavoidable, the result of the structure of the modern world; and its economic consequences would be compounded because of the increased connectivity and overoptimization. As a matter of fact, the government of Singapore, whom we advised in the past, was prepared for such an eventuality with a precise plan since as early as 2010.

Sold ~$5800 worth of BTC through Coinbase this week. $2490 has never been deposited. Unresponsive support. Please upvote for visibility,4bwqsq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4bwqsq/sold_5800_worth_of_btc_through_coinbase_this_week/,"Title says it all. Did three separate transactions to my bank accounts. First and third have hit my account but the second is nowhere to be seen. Opened case, no response, talked to guy on chat said he was pass it on to supervisors, I check back and the case is closed. I reopen case and talk to another person in chat get this:

Henry: Hello there! How can I help you today?

‚ÜíHi Henry I'm trying to get an update on a missing withdraw from early in the week. It's been two days and nobody from support has contacted me

Henry: I see you already have an open support ticket with a supervisor. You're going to need to wait for a reply via email. Live chat cannot help, I'm afraid.

‚ÜíCan you tell me when these people will respond? It feels like I'm being actively avoided

No response after that.


Withdrew $499.47 on 3/21 4:23pm to BMO Harris account, get an e-mail saying 1-2 days, 2 days later money is in my account


Withdrew $2490.38 on 3/21 10:20pm to BMO Harris account, never get an e-mail but money is taken out of coinbase account, never has hit my bank account

Withdrew $2809.49 on 3/22 7:29pm to Capital One 360 account, get an email saying 1-2 days, 2 days later money is in my account.

Am I mad to be anxious about this? I'd like to think that someone would respond from Coinbase to help me out on this. It's not a small sum for me either so I'd like to get it as soon as possible.

I've contacted support, I left a message in the community and twitter but all I here is the deafening silence.



**UPDATE**: **Just got this e-mail as there was a problem on their side which is what I thought, email below**

**Sorry for the trouble with this, there was a problem with the withdrawal as you noticed. I was able to cancel it, and the funds are now back in your USD wallet. You can withdraw whenever you like.**

**Thanks, and please let me know if you have any further questions.**

I've held through all the crashes. Who's laughing now? Not the panic sellers.

Market is all about moving money from impatient to the patient. You see crash, I see opportunity.

You - OMG Bitcoin is crashing, I gotta sell!

Me - OMG Bitcoin is criminally undervalued, I gotta buy!

N.B. Word to the wise for new investors. What I've learned over 7 years is that whenever it crashes spectacularly, the bounce is twice as impactful and record-setting. I can't predict the bottom but I can assure you that it WILL hit 19k and go further beyond, as hard as it may be for a lot of folks to believe right at this moment if you haven't been through it before.

When Bitcoin was at ATH little over a month ago, people were saying, 'it's too pricey now, I can't buy'.

Well, here's your chance at almost 60% discount!

With growing main net adoption of LN, Bitcoin underlying value is greater than it was when it was valued 19k.",1517593702.0,1648,xcryptogurux,1,btc,1

Open Letter to Michael Casey - WSJ reporter who butchered my comments in today's Bitcoin cover story,1z010y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1z010y/open_letter_to_michael_casey_wsj_reporter_who/,"Hello Mr. Casey,

I read your WSJ article today. I feel deceived by you.

You requested to speak with me, so I took time out of my day to do so. We talked for 20 minutes, during which time I conveyed to you my sentiments about the Bitcoin ecosystem and the matter of MtGox's collapse. My message was unambiguously a positive one. I didn't focus whatsoever on the personal funds I lost at Gox. Indeed, the impetus for your call was my heartfelt post on Reddit. 

Yet, you ignored everything I said. The only quote that you published from me in the Journal's cover story was """"That's gone now,"" said Mr. Veerhoos, who is based in Panama City, Panama. ""There's no chance of getting that back now."""" 

Is that really the takeaway you had from our call and from my letter? Is that your idea of journalism? Did I come across with the sentiment of a despairing investor whose confidence has been rattled? It seems you were happy to completely ignore my sentiments, preferring instead to cherry pick the one fact that is least important, in order to paint a narrative that Bitcoin's biggest problem is that it's not ""regulated.""  I didn't expect you to quote everything I said, but should you not have maintained at least a modicum of fidelity to my message?

I have dedicated my life to building and supporting the Bitcoin project. I don't give a damn about the money I lost at Gox. That's not important. What is important is that Bitcoin is resilient and enduring, and will continue to grow and change the world for the better. It is a story of human progress through technology. It is a story of the good seeping into the cracks of a corrupted financial system. It is a story of passionate people struggling against all odds to remedy the calamities brought down upon society from the most potently misguided people and institutions on Earth. 

Next time you spend your efforts casting a pall over this cause, please don't ask me to contribute mine. 

 -Erik Voorhees

PS - I will be posting this letter openly on Reddit. I will post your reply if you'd like. And if I do, I won't cherry pick the most misleading points of it, and I will spell your name correctly.

In mid 2012 I bought 600 Bitcoin.,7qr5a9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7qr5a9/in_mid_2012_i_bought_600_bitcoin/,"In late 2012 I bought 600 BTC. I bought it because I thought in a sense I was donating to a cause, not for an investment. It went to $950. At one point my $4000 was worth half a million, which was almost 10√ó my portfolio. I sold 5 Bitcoin and spent a bit for some weed on the silk road (I was 20, please forgive me. Besides, back then, other than an eBay type website that you could buy gift cards from, you couldnt get much with bitcoin. Anybody remember the famous pizza?) Than bitcoin tumbled to $300. I invested in Doge with some of it, lost a lot there. I had over 5mil doge coin lost in a reddit tip wallet. I took my family on vacation through expedia after i had each of my kids, now 3. And once with my mom, so she could take the grand kids to disney world (she always wanted to take me and my sisters but single parent life sucks) After all the investments I should not have made, and the fun I do not regret having, I am a proud owner of 1.5 BTC.
The reason I made this post is so people can see the ups and downs of Bitcoin. Please understand, everything is about price now, but at one point it wasn't. It was the dread pirate Roberts sticking it to the man, it was people using bitcoin as a way to protest our government bailing out banks and letting us middle class and lower suffer. Trust me when I say a 50% change in bitcoin is not strange. I personally hope it shakes the greedy people off and liberates us like it was designed to do. A world wide currency, untouchable by our greedy governments. If I want to send money to a young man in Taiwan because I believe in his invention, I should be able to. Just as I once sent money to a magic card trading website in exchange for magic internet money because I believed in the cause.

Edit: fat fingers, cell phone post.

But there are other ways! I installed Bitcoin Core on testnet and both Lnd and Eclair and tried opening channels, sending payments, closing channels etc. After a day or so, I discovered two bugs, filed them and cooperated with developers in tracking them and fixing them.

I am mining in the desert using 100% solar and I am profitable,6kk5dp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6kk5dp/i_am_mining_in_the_desert_using_100_solar_and_i/,"I have 7 greenhouses in theSouthwest desert. I have twenty-five S9 miners inside these greenhouses. They are all running 100% off grid with solar and battery power.

I posted my numbers for this mining operation in the desert a few hours ago but it was downvoted into obscurity. Here is the link if anyone is interested:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6kiifr/another_update_on_my_solar_powered_farm_and/

Anyhow, I kinda think that this sub is controlled by miners. I want to test this out to see if it might be true. Cuz...maybe I am just being weird and got it wrong. For the record, I am often wrong.

So here it goes...I have documented my mining operation over the last year here on Reddit. I detailed my idea from when it was just an idea all the way to today, where I have a fully functional and profitable bitcoin mining operation in the middle of the desert....not connected to the grid at all. I am about to go all-in and buy 1,000 miners for the September shipment of new S9's.

Here are the numbers for mining, for those of you who are interested. You will need 6 kw of solar panels. And you will need 15 deep cycle lead-acid batteries (24V/200 amp hours each). And a power control system. I buy the batteries from China for $180 each. I pay $0.45 per watt for solar panels. Total cost for the off grid solution for ONE miner is $6800. It costs so little because I found the suppliers on AliBaba and negotiated my pricing. I am happy to share the suppliers with anyone who is interested (no one will be interested).

Cost for one S9 is $1225 landed on your door in the US. Total cost for the off grid mining solution is $8,000. I make .007 btc per day from each miner. This is about $18 per day at the current price. I make about $300 profit on each miner by reselling it (used). I can buy and sell these miners EVERY time there is a production run from Bitmain. I get in early and secure my order. Then I slowly sell them until the next batch is close to shipping.

I am pretty sure that there are LOTS of miners doing this and they don't want anyone else doing it. They are afraid of flooding the resell market. And they are afraid of increasing demand for miners. And I am pretty sure those people are now running this sub. But again, maybe I am wrong. We'll see...

Basically, I feel that there is a real effort to dissuade people from mining so that miners can continue to do this.

I purchase in advance from Bitmain and secure the lower pricing. I buy 100 miners and I run 25 of them.  I then begin to resell the remainder of my miners. There is such a long gap between shipments from Bitmain that the price just keeps going up and I profit on the resell of these machines. Meanwhile, I am using them to mine until they sell.

By reselling the miners I am making sure I am current with the fastest miners. I also profit from buying 100 miners early in the cycle to resell.

I have NO idea why this happens, but every time I post about mining and talk about how I have found what I believe to be an awesome idea for small to medium sized miners, I am down voted and called a liar and con man by a lot of people here.

So, I am testing my hypothesis. I think that one of three things will happen to this post: (1) it is down voted to obscurity  (2) I am relentlessly called out for being a liar and con man (3) no one cares.

For the record, this should be a post that is read by many people here. I am not trying to say that it is the most amazing thing that someone will read here. But, this is exactly the type of post that should have people discussing in a bitcoin forum.

Anyhow, for those who are interested, this info is not a FAKE POSTING. The numbers are real. I am highly profitable. I wish others would do the exact same thing. I want everyone to be mining.",1498900120.0,921,dan_from_san_diego,1,btc,1

Time to Buy..........,6zshlu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6zshlu/time_to_buy/,"I have called the last 6 serious dips. Just look at my post history.Below I have listed each time. Do you know how I call these. It is so easy as you just have to see the FUD and how thick it gets. Same characters are always involved China, WSJ, CNBC and a army of new posters that spread some serious FUD on both reddit and bitcoin talk. Most posters are new and less than 1 month history on reddit, but they come in droves. 

Here it is for the newbies once again and you need to hammer this in your brain. THERE IS NOT ENOUGH BITCOIN SUPPLY. 16.5 million outstanding and 4-5 million lost through bad passwords and failed hard drives. 2.5-3 million held by the original people like Satoshi ( I am convinced it is the deceased Hal Finney), Craig Wright ect. 4-5 million coins held by Hodlers. It leaves only 5-6 million coins between 20+ major exchanges and the entire WORLD. I keep seeing all this TA, but this is not a stock. The people that sell are going to regret it again, and again. If you are in over your head and need it for bills you should have never bought this. This is when the weak hands get slaughtered. 

I just bought some more at 3915 and keeping another chunk for 3500-3600 range which not sure if it will hit. Take advantage of the FUD. 

Also I really hope China finally bans it outright. they will soon realize you can't ban a decentralized network. They should also ban mining while they are at it. This will be the best news in a long time. I really have a hard time believing China capital outflow theory. There is something else going on, and it could actually be a group of people in China are making major $$$ through the buy/ FOMO / sell / short /FUD / cover / buy. Why else would the second largest economy in the world go after something over and over for the last 4 years. Bitcoin will be so much stronger without these people just like when we split from the big blockers. 

In addition look at all the new tech headed are way. Lightning network, MAST, Schnorr Signatures, and on and on.

/r/Bitcoin FAQ - Newcomers please read,6jlop4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6jlop4/rbitcoin_faq_newcomers_please_read/,"# Welcome to the /r/Bitcoin Sticky FAQ

You've probably been hearing a lot about Bitcoin recently and are wondering what's the big deal?  Most of your questions should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions feel free to ask them in the comments.  

The following videos are a good starting point for understanding how bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:

* [Video 1: What Is Bitcoin & Why Should You Care?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKSQdhxnvCc)
* [Video 2: The real value of bitcoin and crypto currency technology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIVAluSL9SU&index=1&list=FLqnDHJBl3xGTosMjyXc4-0A)
* [Video 3: Bitcoin Is Independent Money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzFOwFXlR48)
* [Video 4: Bitcoin 101 - Balaji Srinivasan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIxwTx7o_B4)

For some more great introductory videos check out [Andreas Antonopoulos's YouTube playlists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkxdys-Ek9U), he is probably the best bitcoin educator out there today.   Also have to give mention to James D'Angelo's [Bitcoin 101 Blackboard series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhe61JaNFLU&index=6&list=PLzctEq7iZD-7-DgJM604zsndMapn9ff6q).  Lots of additional video resources can be found at the [videos wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/videos) or /r/BitcoinTV.  

**Key properties of bitcoin**

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be 21,000,000 bitcoins created and they are issued in a predictable fashion, you can view the inflation schedule [here](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The halving countdown can be found [here](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/).
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read the source code yourself [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin).
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockexplorer.com/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoins reside has the authority to move them.
* **Low fee** - Transactions fees can vary between a few cents and a few dollars depending on network demand and how much priority you wish to assign to the transaction. 
 Most wallets calculate the fee automatically but you can view current fees [here](https://bitcoinfees.21.co/).
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](http://bitcoinglobe.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](http://bitcoinsimplified.org/learn-more/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Encrypted cryptographically and can‚Äôt be [brute forced](https://miguelmoreno.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds to a [few minutes](https://blockchain.info/charts/avg-confirmation-time) depending on need for confirmations.  After a few confirmations transactions are irreversible.  
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries with a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer).
* **Portable** - Bitcoins are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can even be transported by simply [remembering a string of words](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) for wallet recovery.
* **Scalable** - Each bitcoin is [divisible down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability) allowing it to grow in value while still accommodating micro-transactions.
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat

Some excellent writing on Bitcoin's value proposition and future can be found [here](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/).  Bitcoin statistics can be found [here](https://data.bitcoinity.org/bitcoin/hashrate/6m?c=m&g=15&r=week&t=a),

## Where can I buy bitcoins?

[BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) and [Howtobuybitcoin.io](https://howtobuybitcoin.io/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular resources are below, also, check out the [bitcoinity exchange resources](https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/exchanges/USD/30d) for a larger list of options for purchases.  

Bank Transfer | Credit / Debit card | Cash 
---|---|---
[Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) | [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) | [LocalBitcoins](https://localbitcoins.com/)
[Gemini](https://gemini.com/) | [Bitstamp](https://www.bitstamp.net/) | [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
[GDAX](https://www.gdax.com/) | [Bitit](https://www.bitit.gift/?referral=JTWWAIRY) | [Mycelium LocalTrader](http://mycelium.com/lt/help.html)
[Bitstamp](https://www.bitstamp.net/) | [Cex.io](https://cex.io/cards/) | [BitQuick](https://www.bitquick.co/?a=98201) 
[Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/) | [CoinMama](https://www.coinmama.com/) | [WallofCoins](https://wallofcoins.com/en/?frame=1)
[Xapo](https://xapo.com/) | | [BitcoinOTC](https://bitcoin-otc.com/)
[Cex.io](https://cex.io/cards/) | 
[itBit](https://www.itbit.com/) |
[Bitit](https://www.bitit.gift/?referral=JTWWAIRY) |
[Bitsquare](https://bitsquare.io/) |  

[Here](http://coinatmradar.com/) is a listing of local ATMs.  If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Cashila](https://www.cashila.com/) or [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoins are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitfinex/btcusd/1hr) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. [Preev](http://preev.com/btc/usd) is a useful site that  that shows how much various denominations of bitcoin are worth in different currencies. Alternatively you can just Google ""1 bitcoin in (your local currency)"".

## Securing your bitcoins

With bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoins **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold the bitcoins for you.


* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, there are many software wallet options [here](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet).  If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn computer security best practices, then a hardware wallet such as the [Trezor](https://www.bitcointrezor.com/) or [Ledger](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/) is recommended.  A more advanced option is to secure them yourself using [paper wallets](https://bitcoinpaperwallet.com/) generated offline.  Some popular mobile and desktop options are listed below and most are cross platform.  

Android | iOs | Desktop
--------------------|-----|-----
[Mycelium](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mycelium.wallet)  | [BreadWallet](https://itunes.apple.com/app/breadwallet/id885251393) | [Electrum](https://electrum.org/#home)
[CoPay](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bitpay.copay&hl=en) | [AirBitz](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bitcoin-wallet-map-directory/id843536046?mt=8) | [Armory](https://btcarmory.com/)

* If you prefer to let third party **""Bitcoin banks""** manage your coins, try [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) or [Xapo](https://xapo.com/) but be aware you may not be in control of your private keys in which case you would have to ask permission to access your funds and be exposed to third party risk.  

Another interesting use case for physical storage/transfer is the [Opendime](https://opendime.com/).  Opendime is a small USB stick that allows you to spend Bitcoin by physically passing it along so it's anonymous and tangible like cash.  

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code to access your account, usually from a text message or app, making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.  

Google Auth | Authy
--------------------|-----
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/authy/id494168017?mt=8)

A good resource for UK residents is at [wheretospendbitcoins.co.uk](http://www.wheretospendbitcoins.co.uk).

There are also lots of charities which accept bitcoin donations, such as [Wikipedia](https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Ways_to_Give#bitcoin), [Red Cross](https://bitpay.com/520663/donate), [Amnesty International](http://www.amnesty.org/), [United Way](http://www.unitedway.org/content/splash_holiday2014/), [ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/) and the [EFF](https://www.eff.org/). You can find a longer list [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/changetip/wiki/suggestions).

## Merchant Resources

There are several benefits to accepting bitcoin as a payment option if you are a merchant;

* 1-3% savings over credit cards or PayPal.
* No chargebacks (final settlement in 10 minutes as opposed to 3+ months).
* Accept business from a global customer base.
* Increased privacy.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoins can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](http://folding.stanford.edu/).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read more [here](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions you can [run a full node](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/features/) using [this setup guide](https://medium.com/@lopp/how-to-set-up-a-bitcoin-full-node-2dd1c09763d3). [Bitseed](https://bitseed.org/) is an easy option for getting set up.  You can view the global node distribution [here](https://getaddr.bitnodes.io/).

## Earning bitcoins

Just like any other form of money, you can also earn bitcoins by being paid to do a job.

## Bitcoin Units

One Bitcoin is quite large (hundreds of ¬£/$/‚Ç¨) so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | SI unit for milli i.e. millilitre (mL) or millimetre (mm)
microbitcoin | ŒºBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | SI unit for micro i.e microlitre (ŒºL) or micrometre (Œºm)
bit |bit| 1,000,000 per bitcoin| Colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi |sat| 100,000,000 per bitcoin| Smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $500 for one Bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.02 BTC
* 20 mBTC
* 20,000 bits

For more information check out the [Bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

I don't get it..,7c9aj6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7c9aj6/i_dont_get_it/,"I'm fully aware that the big boys will play big games, especially in an unregulated new-ish market such as crypto. I get why BTC and others are swinging like they are. I get the mechanics behind it. That's fine. 

What I don't understand is the empty talk...not just here, but everywhere. To the moon, FUD, the ""real"" bitcoin, attacks, scams, villains. Who gives a shit? If you think rich boys won't play rich boy games, you're naive. It happens in every industry and usually the best solution wins in the end...but the rich always get richer in the process.

In the end, what matters? The technology and its adoption/acceptance/utility. I have to dig 10x harder to find out what the technology roadmaps look like than I do to find out who big bad Roger is and details of his evil plans. Who gives a shit about that guy (or any of the other players)? Does b*cash have actual tangible plans to be successful? If so, I'd love a place to see those plans and make my own decisions. I've seen a lot of upcoming BTC developments (and the obligatory ""yea in 18 months"" replies), but that shows me there are plans and strategies for the next level of the technology. I understand that solid technology requires time to build and implementing a half-baked solution would equal failure. To be the biggest, you can't have those risks. Your big money investors won't tolerate it.

Oh, Chinese miners somewhat control and sway things and have a monopoly on the ASIC miners? Do we not have the ability to build these (likely in a better, faster, more efficient way)? Everybody is just pointing fingers and crying instead of providing guidance and insight.

Oh, transaction fees are too high and the ""market"" doesn't like it?  Well, from the way it seems, 90% of the newly invested money is here for the rollercoaster, unrelated to the technology. The ""older"" money here knows how useful this tech is. Not to mention - if the fees are that significant, can we not get this community involved in supporting education and development? Adoption of segwit addresses reduces fees, right? Are there things we can collectively do to help delivery of LN, Schnorr, other efforts? Let's be a solution to these problems instead of just regurgitating the problems all day. It's like watching CNN or Fox News while trying to actually get educated - won't happen. 

People are also caught up in the religion of Satoshi's ""vision"" which, like anything else, would naturally evolve as the product and technology evolves. Steve Jobs didn't plan on the iPhone on day 1 either, but if you said iPhone in his early days, you'd be against Steve's ""vision"". I don't know....just calm down.

TL,DR: Do you believe in your technology or not? If so, let the power players pay themselves with power moves. Chickens always come home to roost. Let's be educated and united in our belief of the technology. The price will be what we deserve in the end.

Hello from Jimmy Wales of Wikipedia,201fa6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/201fa6/hello_from_jimmy_wales_of_wikipedia/,"So I set up a personal account at Coinbase to play around with bitcoin.  I thought I would buy and sell some, and try to spend on real world things, etc.  I've been watching bitcoin for a long time, of course, and I thought it past due to test it as a consumer - how hard is it, how confusing is it, etc.

Anyway, I mentioned this on twitter and a guy asked for my BTC address (which is: 1McNsCTN26zkBSHs9fsgUHHy8u5S1PY5q3 ) and last night a bunch of people got all excited and sent me BTC.  Obviously I'm going to cash all that out in a few days and send it onward to the Wikimedia Foundation so if you want to keep doing that, I'm ok with it.

In the meantime, I am still learning and I've seen some chatter about me moving the BTC from that address.  I think people are referring to this: https://blockchain.info/tx/29f8972043a293ad2168b62a85e8c9576d8ce6a02d624b9728e33143cae44d64

I didn't do that.  When I first saw it (I'm a newbie, remember!) I was slightly alarmed.  But someone else said that maybe it is coinbase moving it into cold storage.  And when I log into my coinbase account, I don't see anything missing, i.e. I see incoming transactions but no outgoing ones.

How can I best confirm?

I'm planning to re-open the conversation with the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Directors at our next meeting (and before, by email) about whether Wikimedia should accept bitcoin.  One reason (not the only reason) that we haven't is that setting it up as an option during the fundraiser has a lot of implications (we know, for example, and you will likely find this counterintuitive, that the more payment options we give people, the less they donate).  But it occurs to me that they could just set up an account on coinbase and announce it via social media, and not bother with integrating it into donation screens and all that.  The BTC community is pretty close-knit and generous, so that'd probably work pretty well.

tl;dr - I'm playing with bitcoin, thinking about it, and have some questions about how to look at blockchain.info.

You can confirm the address above by looking at my twitter: https://twitter.com/jimmy_wales/status/441634501265862657

"We want to replace YouTube, Dropbox, Facebook, Spotify, ISPs, and more with decentralized apps based on proof of bandwidth. We need developers. Welcome to Bitcloud.",1vd2r1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1vd2r1/we_want_to_replace_youtube_dropbox_facebook/,"Hello. We are at the very early stages of turning the proof of bandwidth idea into a reality. Please read the [nontechnical white paper](https://github.com/wetube/bitcloud/blob/master/Bitcloud%20Nontechnical%20White%20Paper.md) and the [Bitcloud protocol white paper](https://github.com/wetube/bitcloud/blob/master/bitcloud.org). We are going public with this idea because we want to be as open and transparent as possible. This project requires a massive amount of thought and development in many different parts of the protocol, so we need as many people helping as possible.  
  
With the proof of bandwidth concept, we can create decentralized applications for sharing bandwidth and routing network traffic. Bitcloud is a [distrubuted autonomous corporation](http://newswax.com/2014/01/implications-crypto-assets-part-3-distributed-autonomous-corporations/), which means nodes have an incentive to come onto the network. One of the many problems of certain free and open source projects in the past has been the lack of a profit incentive. With Bitcloud, nodes on a mesh network can be rewarded financially for routing traffic in a brand new mesh network. This removes the need for Internet Service Providers (Comcast, Verizon, AT&T, etc.). We can also replace many of the centralized applications on the current Internet, such as YouTube, Dropbox, Facebook, Spotify, and others with decentralized, open source alternatives. We will have to start by decentralizing the current Internet, and then we can create a new Internet to replace it. If you're interested in **privacy, security, ending Internet censorship, decentralizing the Internet, and creating a new mesh network to replace the Internet**, then you should join or support this project.  
  
If you're a developer who sees the potential implications of this project, send an email to developers@bitcloudproject.org.  
If you're someone who wants to help the project in any other way (web design, marketing, graphics design, etc.), send an email to support@bitcloudproject.org.   
We don't think it would be appropriate to take donations at this time, so please hold off on that for now.

This community MUST DEMAND Blockchain evidence of the missing 800k Bitcoin.,1z712z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1z712z/this_community_must_demand_blockchain_evidence_of/,"I, like many others find this whole Mt.Gox debacle very suspicious. Information surrounding Karpeles, 2bitidiot's leak, and US subpoenas is all quite vague and none of it seems to match up. We have been given ZERO conclusive information on how the bitcoins were stolen or even how long ago.

I implore everyone in this community to not just settle for this frog march of Karpeles. With bitcoin we have the ability to PROVE where these coins are.

The elephant in the room is that 800k bitcoin DO NOT just disappear without a trail on the blockchain. We have this ground breaking public ledger technology, lets not take it for granted.

Demand proof! If Gox has control of these coins or not, the BTC MUST be accounted for. Do not let this go by the wayside.  If Mt gox is not able to provide us with this proof not one person should believe the official story.


**EDIT: I did not lose bitcoin in MtGox. I am merely trying to spread awareness of the power blockchain has to prove or disprove claims people make about bitcoins being stolen. There are many class action lawsuits being brought against MtGox and this ability to trace the coins needs to be included in the trial.**

*Must read for newcomers* My friend worked in the Bitcoin industry (broker) for a couple of years and has been involved in the crypto world since 2014. This is what he had to say about the recent politics of btc when someone asked him on our crypto trading channel,72zer0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/72zer0/must_read_for_newcomers_my_friend_worked_in_the/,"(He first sent this article https://medium.com/@StopAndDecrypt/thats-not-bitcoin-this-is-bitcoin-95f05a6fd6c2, then followed up with this reply when someone told him he had no idea what he just read)

""There was a big scaling debate and in the end there were two sides. Those that wanted to scale using bigger blocksize (short term solution that doesn't work long term and also causes more centralization) vs those who wanted to scale using changes in the code to make the network more efficient aka SEGWIT+second layer scaling solutions (bitcoin becomes massive settlement layer, and second layer solutions can take care of verifying your $3.25 coffee payment). 

On the big block side you had (most) miners because they were only able to see the short term benefits of increased blocksize and they do not care about network centralization. Also, a chinese miner controlling a sizeable chunk of the network's hashrate had access to (and was in the process of patenting) this technology called ASICBOOST which is an exploit in bitcoin code that allows you to ""cheat"" and get extra hashing power out of your miners. Essentially they had an unfair advantage and the KEY is that the segwit upgrade fixes this exploit. Alongside these miners you had a couple of misguided (but incredibly wealthy because of early adoption) individuals who either have a reason to see bitcoin fail (like they are heavily invested in altcoins now) or they are too pigheaded to back down when wrong (or some of them I'm sure are not actually intelligent enough to understand they are wrong).

On the Segwit side you had all the core developers (the guys who worked side by side with satoshi to build all this and have been contributing to the code for years every day), the majority of the userbase, AND the vast majority of bitcoin companies. The two sides were basically arguing over who had control over bitcoin - was it the miners, or was it the users? Was it those who chose which software to run (users) or was it those who verified transactions for that software (miners)? (The answer as you will see shortly is Users). So basically these miners were stalling the upgrade because it would mean the end of their unfair (AND patented) advantage. This massive stalemate in the debate caused a community led uprising known as the User Activated Soft Fork movement (UASF). These guys basically said ""We're switching our nodes to Segwit software starting Aug 1 and we will be rejecting all mined blocks that do not comply with the new code"". This forced the miners' hand as they realized they would either be forked off the network or have to go along with the new upgrade to make sure everything continued to go smoothly (including their profits).

The movement gained enough support to freak out some big money bitcoin CEOs who got together in a room with the miners and made a deal behind closed doors known as the New York Agreement (NYA). This is where Segwit2x was born. The key to note here is that not a single core dev was invited to this meeting (in fact, not a single competent dev in general was invited). The terms of the deal were: You guys agree to implement Segwit now, and then we'll agree to an increase in block size later (November). Deal was made and obviously the majority of the user community was in an uproar because bitcoiners hate closed door deals (and they should for good reason). 

That being said, it got Segwit activated because it gave miners an easy way to safe face and go with segwit and the community instead of seeing their profits get wrecked by a messy chainsplit. However, do you remember that sneaky miner who had patented the ASICBOOST technology? Well he was part of the NYA and he decided to fork off anyway and create Bitcoin Cash. So stop right here and realize that the only reason we have bitcoin cash is so that some miner with a ton of hashing power could keep his unfair advantage over the network (he stills mainly mines bitcoin by the way because he would go out of business if he switched entirely to bitcoin cash). Also at this point, technically the NYA was broken because the whole point of it was to avoid a chainsplit and go with segwit followed by a block size increase whereas bitcoin cash was a clear chainsplit.

So for a few months everything was ok because we had Segwit, core devs were still with us, and (supposedly) anyone who wanted bigger blocks had forked off to bitcoin cash right? Wrong. See it turns out that those guys who made that backroom deal with the miners also had their own interests which involve removing the current core developers from their (imagined) seat of power. It is classic old school business politics - they don't care that core the devs are based around principles of meritocracy and peer review. They just want to have more of a say in the direction bitcoin takes. At this point, you might be thinking, ""Ok but its fair for companies who use a product to have a say in its development, right?"" NO. Not when the ""product"" at stake is meant to be an incredibly secure, incorruptible ledger that can hold trillions of dollars in wealth and still be hosted online accross the world. 

The fact is that no one understands the code better than the core developers and no one has more of an interest in seeing bitcoin stay decentralized and secure than these guys do. These guys literally cum buckets everyday to how much they love coding bitcoin. If Satoshi is Cypher Jesus then these guys are his Apostles. And on the other hand you have some severely misguided corporate buffoons who think they have the knowledge to negotiate a compromise with a group who has nothing but short term profit in their sights. And when the core developers are like ""wtf dude?"" and the community stands behind them, then these guys resort to essentially trying to kick core out of bitcoin by starting a new chain. A new chain which was based on a compromise that no one wants or needs anymore. And the excuse these CEO's are hiding behind is ""We don't want to go back on our word."" Classic business mindset vs coding mindset.

ur word."" Classic business mindset vs coding mindset. 

Now we come to the current situation where there are basically 4 sides

1. Core developers, and those supporting them
2. The (remaining) signers of the NYA and those supporting Segwit2x 
3. Malicious third parties who just want to see bitcoin fail (invested in altcoins/bitcoin cash or they are the Joker and just want to see shit burn)
4. Innocent bystanders


The core developers are continuing to code and improve bitcoin and they are working on second layer solutions. They haven't stopped development and have actually made a TON of beneficial changes to the code since the Segwit upgrade allowed them to. Being non-political or atleast being shit politicians, these guys do not know how to handle themselves with other people and either don't speak much or come off as pretentious d*bags (trust me I used to hate them before I smartened up). 

The remaining NYA signers. I say remaining because alot of companies left when they saw the massive backlash from the community. The only signers left are miners and then a group of around 30 companies which all have ties to Barry Silbert's holding company Digital Currency Group and suprise surprise who do you think got that NYA meeting together in the first place? Silly Silbert indeed. He's basically trying to do a sort of corporate take over of bitcoin where he decides who is writing the code and how they write it. Oh also I should note here that these guys have 1 developer working on the Segwit2x code. Yes 1, Jeff Garzik. Coding ability? Mediocre at best. All he did was copy and paste the entire bitcoin core code (because its open source) and changed the one little value that dictates block size. He changed a 1 to a 2 haha! And when he tried to make other changes he made critical mistakes that had to be fixed by CORE DEVELOPERS hahahaha! So how the f* does that even compare to an army of geeks who have been coding bitcoin for years and coding in general for decades who are all constantly trying to find mistakes in each others' work. SO people supporting Segwit2x are either severely misguided, hate core devs, or don't have all the information to make an informed decision.

Now the malicious actors. These are people who have a vested interest in seeing bitcoin crumble. I'm talking about big altcoin investors and bitcoin cash supporters (yes the guys who have ASICBOOST and want are the reason for this whole mess in the first place). And Segwit2x has presented them with a beautiful vector of attack. Divide and conquer. Right? And whereas with bitcoin cash there was replay protection (meaning the split was pretty clean and bitcoin was largely unaffected) this time they haven't got any planned - so should things go through as planned, things could get messy.

Then you have all those innocent bystanders who don't really know what to think anymore. Things have gotten so convoluted and complicated that it is hard to follow who wants what anymore. These are the people who will get the most fucked by something like Segwit2x because they won't understand the risks as it is happening and they won't have the knowledge to know which wallets to support. Imagine Segwit2x happens and one wallet sticks with the core version of bitcoin and the other wallet supports the segwit2x version but they both just say ""Bitcoin"".
 
That is why people are soooooooooooooo strongly opposed to Segwit2x more than anything. It is nothing more and nothing less than a hostile takeover attempt. And at this point that should be more than clear because why else would you still support the compromise made with miners who broke the compromise by creating bitcoin cash? No one wanted Segwit2x in the first place. People wanted bigger blocks, or segwit, not both. Segwit2x was never a faction in the debate. It was a faction that was spawned by those who created the NYA because they saw an opportunity take control of the software development from a group of developers who have been working on it for years and who strongly oppose corporate interests getting involved in bitcoin development.""

"Andreas Antonopoulos posted this response to ""a prominent member of the bitcoin community"" on patreon.",7hylea,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7hylea/andreas_antonopoulos_posted_this_response_to_a/,"Andreas M. Antonopoulos posted
In defense of optimism
Yesterday, I woke to a flurry of activity on Twitter. A prominent member of the bitcoin community had decided to a message to me that many perceived as critical. The tweet pointed out that had I managed my money better I would be wealthy and wouldn't need the support of patrons.
It was in response to a message I posted on Twitter a week earlier, to once again dispel the impression that I am a bitcoin millionaire. It is hard for many to accept that someone who has been involved since 2012 has not amassed a great fortune in bitcoin. The truth, however, is that due to circumstances and some poor choices I made, I was not able to benefit as much from the rise of bitcoin as some others have.

At the end of 2012, when I heard about bitcoin, I had been working as a freelance consultant for about a year after burning out of my previous work as a partner in a research firm. I had a modest retirement fund, a small amount of credit card debt and enough income to make ends meet. I was really in limbo, looking for the next opportunity. Bitcoin arrived into my awareness and slapped me in the face. You've all heard my story of tumbling down the rabbit hall, absolutely consumed by awe.

What is not quite obvious is that my obsession also drove me to abandon my consulting work and put all my attention into bitcoin. I worked as hard as I have ever worked, focusing full time on this technology. During this time, I was unable to find any way of making a living through bitcoin. I traveled to speak at conferences (which didn't even cover expenses), I consulted with startups (which couldn't pay me), I wrote articles etc. To support my ""habit"", I dipped into my savings. I cut back on my expenses as much as I could and started ravaging my savings. By mid-2013 I was forced to start liquidating my retirement funds. In my early 40's, I was undoing a lifetime of savings, in a way most people would consider irresponsible. While doing so, I incurred penalty taxes for early withdrawal. Then, I went into credit card debt. By the end of 2013 I was ""worse than broke"": going into debt at an alarming rate.

Finally, in 2014 I started making a bit of income. I was so deep in debt that I continued to live paycheck to paycheck, struggling to chip away at my debt. It was going to be a long two years before I finally became debt free at the end of 2016.

I won't complain about the lost opportunity. I am extremely fortunate to be able to live debt free, doing my dream job in a field I absolutely love.

Yesterday, while reading the tweet that criticized me for my poor choices, I felt sick to my stomach. It forced me to confront and relive every choice I made and all the missed opportunities. You see, the critical tweet contained a big grain of truth. I could've become wealthy. If only I hadn't sold. If only I hadn't given away hundreds of bitcoin to complete strangers. If only I had reduced my expenses more. If only I had made smarter choices. If only...

Working in bitcoin is an endless struggle against cynicism, negativity, regret. Throughout the last 5 years I have always tried to maintain an optimistic and positive outlook, to focus on the long term, to think about the potential to lift billions out of poverty. But every now and then, I get dragged back into the negative. Yesterday was one of those days. I felt crushed.

And then, something amazing happened. Over the next several hours, tens, dozens, then hundreds of people responded. I sat reading the responses with tears in my eyes. An outpouring of positivity washed over me. People I have never met jumped to my defense, reminding me that they started their journey after watching my videos, or reading my books. Some people attacked the original criticism and its author (which I strongly discourage). But the vast majority focused on optimism.

Not only did people remind me of the importance of my work, they also encouraged each other to support me. In the last year, I have gradually received more and more of my income from Patreon. Patreon allows me to regain my financial security without switching my focus to commercial conferences, banking and investment events and chasing the next paycheck. Because of Patreon, I managed to stop selling and finally HODL. Because of Patreon I can dedicate my entire focus to the people who I have always felt like I am working for: the community of crypto-currency dreamers, visionaries and creators. I now finally get to work for you.

Yesterday, you fed my soul. You reminded me why it is so important to remain optimistic, focused and determined to overcome the cynicism. It's been a long and hard road. Sometimes I get lost. But, every time I do, you step up and help me find my way, find my focus again. You show me that I do not walk alone on this path. You are all there with me. I am part of a wonderful community and you have my back.

Today, I am even more focused on my goals: educate the next 10 million users. Train the next 10,000 developers. Do it all in every medium possible. Do it in more languages. Do it with more energy, with more passion. Do it with unrelenting optimism. In the end, my engine runs on hope, it runs on optimism. And today, it's turbocharged.

He went on to discuss a decentralized internet on the blockchain which would inherently require a coin to function properly.

"I'm one of the developers of Honey, a browser extension with 700K users. We have an idea for a feature that lets people spend bitcoins seamlessly on Amazon. If you guys like it, we'll build it.",1sqznf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1sqznf/im_one_of_the_developers_of_honey_a_browser/,"I am one of the cofounders of [Honey](http://www.joinhoney.com), a browser extension that automatically searches and applies coupon codes for online shoppers at checkout.  I'm also a fan of bitcoins and its disruptive potential.

One of the biggest weakness of bitcoins at the moment is the lack of merchant support - especially large online retailers like Amazon. Unfortunately, it's a hard sale to get merchants to introduce a new payment concept to people who are about to checkout -- this could cause people to abandon the cart to go off to read about what this ""bitcoin"" thing is. Unless there's compelling evidence that the reward is greater than the risk, merchants like Amazon will not take that chance. 

We have an idea for adding a feature in Honey that can help prove the value of bitcoin as a payment method to giants like Amazon.  The user experience goes like this:

* You are checking out on Amazon
* If you have Honey installed, you will see a ""pay with bitcoins"" button on the page
* Hit the button and you will be asked to pay the total in bitcoins. The payment is sent to Honey
* When the bitcoin payment is confirmed, Honey applies an Amazon gift card in the exact amount to your shopping cart
* Your balance is now $0 and you complete the purchase

[See the step by step mock-up](http://imgur.com/a/UnKc8)

Honey is simply selling you an Amazon gift card for bitcoins, like Gyft.  The difference is in the user experience.  The same technology we're using to automatically apply coupon codes can be used to apply gift cards, and it makes the experience frictionless.  It should feel exactly the same as paying for something with your CC.

Some additional benefits:
 
* We will be introducing the concept of bitcoins to our 700K users, potentially bringing many of them into the ecosystem
* We will collect and publish data about volume and checkout completion rates as reference for large retailers

We are a tiny team of developers so we don't want to commit the time to building something like this unless we know people want it.  We would love to hear your feedback and if there's enough demand for it, we will build it.

EDIT: formatting

EDIT2: Wow, we are floored by the feedback and the support.  It looks like we're going to have to build it or we might risk losing our kneecap.  We'll be putting the development plans in motion first thing tomorrow.  We'll be posting updates on Twitter [@savehoney](https://twitter.com/SaveHoney) periodically.

I am mining in the suburbs using 100% hydropower from my backyard creek and supplementing with backup power from hamster wheels. I am profitable AMA.,6kno7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6kno7l/i_am_mining_in_the_suburbs_using_100_hydropower/,"I have 1 microhydro plant running 24/7 in Braggadocio, Missouri. I have twenty-five hundred hamster wheels inside these greenhouses. All hamsters are running 100% off fair trade coffee, with soul cycle music pumped through small speakers in a surround-sound-system-setup playing non-stop.

I posted my numbers for this mining operation a few hours ago but it was downvoted into obscurity. Here is a link of the first hamster I had working this job if anyone is interested:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkNTAiWX8g0

His name was Mr. Geppetto, and he was the Genesis Hamster.

Anyhow, I kinda think that this sub is controlled by Jihan and Roger. I want to test this out to see if it might be true. Cuz...maybe I am just being weird and got it wrong. For the record, I am often right.
So here it goes...I have documented my mining operation over the last week here on Reddit. I detailed my idea from when it was just an idea all the way to today, where I have a fully functional and profitable bitcoin mining operation in the middle of the Missouri....not connected to the grid at all. I am about to go all-in and buy 1,000,000 miners for the September shipment of new S10's.

Here are the numbers for mining, for those of you who are interested. You will need 1 microhydro plant. And you will need 2500 hamster wheels, or alternatively one very large hamster wheel and a black bear. And a power control system. I buy the batteries from Walmart for $99 each, I keep the receipt an return them after 29 days. Total cost for the off grid hydro/hamster solution is $350. It costs so little because I'm also getting royalties from my onecoin investment. I am happy to share the suppliers with anyone who is interested (please clap).

I make 7 btc per day from each hamster. This is about 17500btc per day. I'm not calculating my profit because I'm not trying to cause the price to drop. 

I am pretty sure that there are LOTS of hamster trainers doing this and they don't want anyone else doing it. They are afraid of flooding sewer system with hamster poop pellets like the hog farms have done in Duplin County and across the States. And they are afraid of increasing demand for hamster food. And I am pretty sure those people are now running this sub. But again, maybe I am wrong. We'll see...
Basically, I feel that there is a real effort to dissuade people from bonding with hamsters and using hydropower so that miners can continue to do this.

I purchase one hamster and secure the lowest pricing per hamster. We do not employ guinea pigs. They are lazy. If one hamster listens to any song by Sade (or for the thug hamsters Poetic Justice by Kendrick) for more than 5 minutes they will make sweet hamster love and 100 baby hamsters will be born within a few days and I can resell the surplus hamsters on craigslist. 

By breeding hamsters myself I am making sure I am getting the best thorough bred, strongest, fastest hamsters, and no Guinea pigs. I also profit from dressing the charismatic ones in costumes and renting them out to birthday parties and corporate events for $79.99 an hour per hamster. Also in case you're wondering, I match 100% each hamster's contribution to his or her IRA. This isn't a sweatshop.

I have NO idea why this happens, but every time I post about hamsters and talk about how I have found what I believe to be an awesome idea for anyone who loves animals and lambos, I am down voted and called a liar and con man by a lot of people here.

So, I am testing my hypothesis. I think that one of three things will happen to this post: (1) it is down voted to obscurity (2) I am relentlessly called out for being a liar and con man (3) no one cares.
For the record, this should be a post that is read by many people here. I am not trying to say that it is the most amazing thing that someone will read here. But, this is exactly the type of post that should have people discussing in a bitcoin forum.

Anyhow, for those who are interested, this info is not a FAKE POSTING. The numbers are real. I am highly profitable. I wish others would do the exact same thing. I want everyone to be raising hamsters and using hydropower.

Tether was hacked by the same person who hacked Bitstamp in 2015 (x-post /r/cryptocurrency),7ehseb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7ehseb/tether_was_hacked_by_the_same_person_who_hacked/,"Decided to have a look at what we could learn about the Tether hack from the blockchain, the coins are still moving around so I may edit this later as this develops.

It actually starts with this wallet here:

https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/12f4885dad525cc1

Look familiar? Go to the last page, that was the wallet used to steal 19000BTC from Bitstamp back in January 2015 (and which was still receiving coins from Bitstamp as recently as September, well done guys).

This wallet made two transactions, the first is fairly innocuous but I'll come back to it later:

https://www.walletexplorer.com/txid/7b46c7e412b1f1e93ff0aa67232457dde3fb6e91f4c61e025a97e56290049050

This address then sends out a further 0.01BTC:

https://www.walletexplorer.com/address/1LBQpqUTEmdPTH8adaV6xS8KQt6FGCD3xD

The following morning it sends 0.01 to the address that was several hours later used to empty the Tether wallet:

https://www.walletexplorer.com/address/31okFF1rUu8jjPEVuajycTRBp82Nteo4Mv

I'm not quite sure why they would make a deposit like this to it hours before - perhaps to test that everything is working?

*Edit: I believe this was actually to ensure they had BTC for transaction fees moving the tethers around*

At 10:53, the wallet makes several transactions transferring 23 million tethers from the tether wallet:

https://omniexplorer.info/lookupadd.aspx?address=31okFF1rUu8jjPEVuajycTRBp82Nteo4Mv

Then at 11:10 they transfer another 7.9 million tethers. A further 50,000 tethers are transferred over at 11:54.

At 12:01, 5BTC (the bulk of the bitcoin in the tether wallet) is transferred over to the same address:

https://www.walletexplorer.com/txid/e7e09cd092a5febdcae6b2ec76b06389c29298ed237dd1f210e1e54f096f1f92

These tethers are then transferred over to the address in the Tether announcement as their relevant blocks are confirmed.

https://omniexplorer.info/lookupadd.aspx?address=16tg2RJuEPtZooy18Wxn2me2RhUdC94N7r

The 5BTC is also transferred to this address in amounts of roughly 1BTC per transaction:

https://www.walletexplorer.com/address/31okFF1rUu8jjPEVuajycTRBp82Nteo4Mv

Following the BTC along, you arrive back at an address from before, which is confirmed to be part of the wallet holding the stolen Tether:

https://blockchain.info/tx/eeaf8b9c6288c28c481d6e37d687b5c42b0222fb3d8a73bdca81c1a12243c579

It's worth noting that this same address was just used to create an Omni token called lioncoin:

https://omniexplorer.info/lookupsp.aspx?sp=2147484016

The BTC from the tether wallet ended up in these addresses:

https://blockchain.info/address/1HtmVRdFRqPScH7Ud6UFR6HUcndksjVmua

https://blockchain.info/address/155KG55pRsV1Y9jdwwynfGHGqR9cqPKToB

https://blockchain.info/address/1M8b8BNMEMFFem9UQpZydoespHzXjAnC9t

I will update this post as more develops.

*Edit 1*

This wallet from the Tether and Bitstamp hacks seems to be owned by the same person who took 12000BTC from Huobi in late 2015, interesting...

https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/002d28cac852fc7d

*Edit: Huobi are saying this is not a hack, so who knows why 12000 or so bitcoin was withdrawn from their exchange and combined with the coins from bitstamp [see here](https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/002d28cac852fc7d) before being passed through several more wallets and onto BTC-e in batches of 1000 or so.*

Before he was taking thousands of BTC off exchanges and sending it to BTC-e, he also used to sell much smaller amounts on Localbitcoins.

https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/02f08eddae4ba788

https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/f4b4c44dd6a146fd

https://www.walletexplorer.com/txid/0e9ae0a86dafc3a8dde0578871e51212c1e962ebf5a3306904b4e2eca25e0ba6

So Localbitcoins guys, if you have a log of who was using [this address](https://www.walletexplorer.com/address/1EvTV4ySZbwwsRfL6T723cg1iiFASJbqH3) back in 2015, you've got the hacker ;)

*Edit 2*

So I was [asked](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7eho5y/tether_was_hacked_by_the_same_person_who_hacked/dq558sd/) whether this could be an inside job.

Well, maybe? I don't think there's enough evidence from chain analysis alone to draw a conclusion.

Some of the transactions which funded the lioncoin address came from an old Bitfinex wallet, and [some came from the bitstamp hack address](https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/6b1a2139799a82b8). Bear in mind that this is [part of the same wallet](https://blockchain.info/tx/eeaf8b9c6288c28c481d6e37d687b5c42b0222fb3d8a73bdca81c1a12243c579) that the stolen tethers were sent to.

Also if you look at the [tether address](https://omniexplorer.info/lookupadd.aspx?address=3BbDtxBSjgfTRxaBUgR2JACWRukLKtZdiQ&page=1) you'll notice that when other blocks of tether were released they were quickly transferred to the Bitfinex wallet, with this 30 million being the exception, that said in prior months they had regularly left millions of tether in this address for days at a time, so this isn't necessarily a red flag.

It could be that the attacker had access to the main tether issuance address (3MbYQMM etc) or it may just be that they noticed the 30 million tethers sat on the wallet that they could manipulate. Presumably Tether know whether or not they intended to make [this](https://omniexplorer.info/lookuptx.aspx?txid=dbde10653dd7f459260c11e2a80ae887f7c72e5bfd22f5d908b489dd430be764) transaction. Without knowing that we can only speculate on whether the compromise went beyond the address that was emptied.

*Edit 3*

There is a post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tether/comments/7ei568/tether_return/) in which a /u/bitconexfoier1 claims to have bought 10M tethers, and provides an address that [received 10 million tethers](https://omniexplorer.info/lookupadd.aspx?address=13kyHqsbtZpRHDNSdXWniJiCZPvRtMjVao) (now invalid) from the hackers.

[Lightning] I didn't believe it until I saw it,7rb03f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7rb03f/lightning_i_didnt_believe_it_until_i_saw_it/,"Moderately long post, tl;dr at the bottom.  

I've seen lightning transaction gifs and videos over and over. Today, I decided to fire up a lightning node on my laptop and give it a shot.

I followed [this](https://medium.com/@ajs1287/setting-up-bitcoin-lightning-network-node-on-macos-is-peanuts-eclair-5afbef553d71) walk-through for mac (I adapted it to Arch Linux) for setting up Bitcoin TestNet Node with Eclair Lightning (it's practically the same as Mac, except for the installation process).  
Running on Arch caused the problem of accidentally installing the latest dev version of Bitcoin Core ([AUR:bitcoin-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/bitcoin-git/)) - also had some compilation issues because upstream moved some files and this hadn't been updated in the PKGBUILD.  

The latest dev version of Bitcoin Core included the SegWit address generation by default, which was very nice, didn't have any bugs using it in the brief period I used it.  

After a couple of hours of syncing the TestNet blocks on my laptop, I started up Eclair and got Eclair and Bitcoin Core connected (had to use `bitcoin-qt --deprecatedrpc=addwitnessaddress`becuase Eclair calls a soon-to-be deprecated function), sent myself some tBTC, and started opening up channels.  
Once I had about 3 channels open, I went to everyone's favorite [online coffee shop](https://starblocks.acinq.co/#/) and rewarded myself with some imaginary coffee.  

My mind was absolutely blown at how fast the transaction went through and how insanely low the fees were (10 sat).  

I went to test a transaction with a couple more hops, bought myself an imaginary 100eur Steam voucher, paid 100 sat in fees, near instant transaction (my Eclair client took a couple seconds to find a route to bitrefill)

Lightning truly is an incredible addition to Bitcoin, big things are coming.  

tl;dr - Saw a couple lightning transaction videos and gifs, didn't really sink in how amazing this really is, decided to give it a shot on linux, mind=blown  

**Edit:** I've done a little further testing and noticed that Eclair doesn't warn you if you're opening a duplicate channel (open a second channel with the same node)",1516322906.0,665,Kill3rism,1,btc,1

I sent a 5 Btc deposit over 2 months ago which they froze and asked me for a scan of my Passport + a photo of me holding a piece of paper which I sent them.

After a week of not hearing back, I messaged them again and they asked me the origin of the funds which I explained.

More time passed with no news, and I messaged them again and they asked me for my social media information which I gave them.

Last week they completely suspended my account and closed my support tickets, and they have not been replying to me at all anymore.

I have given them everything they have asked from me and they have still not released my funds after 2+ months!

If anyone from HitBTC is reading this, my requests tickets are #221775, #267139 and #274005.

"One of the last posts made by Hal Finney on bitcointalk.org. For the uninitiated, Hal received the first ever transaction of bitcoin. 10 coins from Satoshi.",7jsp0s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7jsp0s/one_of_the_last_posts_made_by_hal_finney_on/,"I thought I'd write about the last four years, an eventful time for Bitcoin and me.

For those who don't know me, I'm Hal Finney. I got my start in crypto working on an early version of PGP, working closely with Phil Zimmermann. When Phil decided to start PGP Corporation, I was one of the first hires. I would work on PGP until my retirement. At the same time, I got involved with the Cypherpunks. I ran the first cryptographically based anonymous remailer, among other activities.

Fast forward to late 2008 and the announcement of Bitcoin. I've noticed that cryptographic graybeards (I was in my mid 50's) tend to get cynical. I was more idealistic; I have always loved crypto, the mystery and the paradox of it.

When Satoshi announced Bitcoin on the cryptography mailing list, he got a skeptical reception at best. Cryptographers have seen too many grand schemes by clueless noobs. They tend to have a knee jerk reaction.

I was more positive. I had long been interested in cryptographic payment schemes. Plus I was lucky enough to meet and extensively correspond with both Wei Dai and Nick Szabo, generally acknowledged to have created ideas that would be realized with Bitcoin. I had made an attempt to create my own proof of work based currency, called RPOW. So I found Bitcoin facinating.

When Satoshi announced the first release of the software, I grabbed it right away. I think I was the first person besides Satoshi to run bitcoin. I mined block 70-something, and I was the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction, when Satoshi sent ten coins to me as a test. I carried on an email conversation with Satoshi over the next few days, mostly me reporting bugs and him fixing them.

Today, Satoshi's true identity has become a mystery. But at the time, I thought I was dealing with a young man of Japanese ancestry who was very smart and sincere. I've had the good fortune to know many brilliant people over the course of my life, so I recognize the signs.

After a few days, bitcoin was running pretty stably, so I left it running. Those were the days when difficulty was 1, and you could find blocks with a CPU, not even a GPU. I mined several blocks over the next days. But I turned it off because it made my computer run hot, and the fan noise bothered me. In retrospect, I wish I had kept it up longer, but on the other hand I was extraordinarily lucky to be there at the beginning. It's one of those glass half full half empty things.

The next I heard of Bitcoin was late 2010, when I was surprised to find that it was not only still going, bitcoins actually had monetary value. I dusted off my old wallet, and was relieved to discover that my bitcoins were still there. As the price climbed up to real money, I transferred the coins into an offline wallet, where hopefully they'll be worth something to my heirs.

Speaking of heirs, I got a surprise in 2009, when I was suddenly diagnosed with a fatal disease. I was in the best shape of my life at the start of that year, I'd lost a lot of weight and taken up distance running. I'd run several half marathons, and I was starting to train for a full marathon. I worked my way up to 20+ mile runs, and I thought I was all set. That's when everything went wrong.

My body began to fail. I slurred my speech, lost strength in my hands, and my legs were slow to recover. In August, 2009, I was given the diagnosis of ALS, also called Lou Gehrig's disease, after the famous baseball player who got it.

ALS is a disease that kills moter neurons, which carry signals from the brain to the muscles. It causes first weakness, then gradually increasing paralysis. It is usually fatal in 2 to 5 years. My symptoms were mild at first and I continued to work, but fatigue and voice problems forced me to retire in early 2011. Since then the disease has continued its inexorable progression.

Today, I am essentially paralyzed. I am fed through a tube, and my breathing is assisted through another tube. I operate the computer using a commercial eyetracker system. It also has a speech synthesizer, so this is my voice now. I spend all day in my power wheelchair. I worked up an interface using an arduino so that I can adjust my wheelchair's position using my eyes.

It has been an adjustment, but my life is not too bad. I can still read, listen to music, and watch TV and movies. I recently discovered that I can even write code. It's very slow, probably 50 times slower than I was before. But I still love programming and it gives me goals. Currently I'm working on something Mike Hearn suggested, using the security features of modern processors, designed to support ""Trusted Computing"", to harden Bitcoin wallets. It's almost ready to release. I just have to do the documentation.

And of course the price gyrations of bitcoins are entertaining to me. I have skin in the game. But I came by my bitcoins through luck, with little credit to me. I lived through the crash of 2011. So I've seen it before. Easy come, easy go.

That's my story. I'm pretty lucky overall. Even with the ALS, my life is very satisfying. But my life expectancy is limited. Those discussions about inheriting your bitcoins are of more than academic interest. My bitcoins are stored in our safe deposit box, and my son and daughter are tech savvy. I think they're safe enough. I'm comfortable with my legacy.",1513297953.0,295,,1,btc,1

3rd(?) best day of my life! AMA!,7iuqwk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iuqwk/3rd_best_day_of_my_life_ama/,"I was sifting through my things in storage. I used to be self employed doing IT consulting. I found my old computer. I thought I might have part of a bitcoin or two on there as I‚Äôve been an avid bitcoin evangelist. So opened up a command prompt and in C:\ typed ‚Äúdir wallet.dat /a/s‚Äù and I found one.  So I looked and apparently I had run the windows GUI for bitcoind on this machine at one point.

I opened up the bitcoin GUI and the balance stated: 55. I was confused for a second and asked myself ‚Äú55? Why does it say 55?‚Äù  I looked at the transaction log and I saw two things: an entry for having signed a block and a payment of 5 extra BTC.

I live down the street from my parents and I shot up, ran out the door down to my parents house ‚ÄúDad! Dad! We gotta go, I need you to come to my house right now, don‚Äôt worry about shoes!‚Äù  Being a once in a life time event I felt he could run to my house barefoot and see this with me ... dick move I know!  He was excited, he‚Äôs one of those guys that got on the hype train at 5500 and threw a couple hundred bucks in lol!

So I grabbed the wallet.dat, threw it up on my ‚Äúvault‚Äù server I run, and waited for it to convert and scan the whole blockchain again. An hour later ... I am surprised I have my fingernails left... I typed ‚Äúbitcoin getbalance‚Äù on my box and sure enough.. ‚Äú55.00000000‚Äù. Pretty sure my right hand still hurts from the high five I gave my dad!  I also play Eve Online, and I might have been laughing my ass off and having a great time with my alliance as well ... god I‚Äôm a nerd! Went over to my best friend‚Äôs house, told her as she has had to suffer through endless bitcoin is great rants, she was like ‚Äústfu! No you didn‚Äôt! Omfg!‚Äù

In the summer of 2010 I was able to sign a block using a Core I7-920, and since it was worth (roughly) 7 cents a bitcoin then, I determined my computer power was better spent doing other stuff and/or not mining. A bit after that I upgraded my 3 drive raid 0 to an SSD and didn‚Äôt migrate everything. A couple years back I found a couple wallet.dat files on that SSD but didn‚Äôt check the raid array until Friday.

I called my cousin who is a CPA/lawyer, and I told her that I had felt like I had won the lottery and she said to me ‚Äúevery time I hear about bitcoin I think of you, you didn‚Äôt win the lottery, you were Into it before the hype, you knew what it was when other people thought it was and still think it is weird. The real thing is you‚Äôre lucky because you forgot about it!‚Äù  This week, I‚Äôm going to pay off my house/car/credit cards, put at least 150k into a college fund for my two boys, start looking into paying my taxes and you know pinching myself to make sure I‚Äôm not dreaming!

While I should HODL... I have cashed out most of them ... I feel like not having a mortgage payment was a huge plus. And by the way, Bitcoin Cash and the other forks... bless your hearts!  The day my two boys were born were the two best days of my life!  Merry-f‚Äôing-Christmas!

Got scammed out of 70K... is there anything I can do?,833ffc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/833ffc/got_scammed_out_of_70k_is_there_anything_i_can_do/,"
**BREAKING -- the scam websites (x7) are now offline thanks to the work/complaints from this post**
**TLDR: Don't trust new wallets unless you're 100% sure or you will lose everything**

First off, Yes - I feel sheepish, yes had I spent more time researching it wouldnt of happened, Yes I realize that I am a moron for letting **$70K USD** slip out of my hands, so please dont remind me of that, I learned that lesson.  The website was legit looking, I trusted it wouldnt come from googles top searches pointing to Reddit which then pointed to a scam from this user > https://www.reddit.com/user/jhkansen1

Secondly, I lost my BTC after importing a private key (after I had sent my funds to a new wallet) into a wallet downloaded from electrumbtcp,com (DO NOT GO HERE.) I then transferred my funds BACK into Exodus but mistakenly didn't create a NEW address by clicking the ARROW on the right.  This mistake cost me $70K USD.

I got into cryptocurrency a few years ago, but not in a heavy sense, just as a merchant accepting BTC. I ran a large minecraft server and a small portion of our user base shopped in BTC back when it was $200-300.  While this didn't give me anywhere near the $70K that I lost, it got me started.  I then invested what I could into ETH early on and hodl'd it as long as possible.  I wouldn't consider myself a ""newbie"" at trading, investing or mining for awhile.  I've done several forked coins and I didn't, in my wildest dreams, think that it'd be a malicious wallet.  I've been trained to ""Send coins, get the private key - send funds back to newly created address"" - I thought thats what I was doing.  

I know my funds are probably gone forever, I want to know how I can warn others, how I can report this to (whatever? country authorities) as a malicious website.  I'm not looking for attention as much as I'm looking for possible help with bringing down this website.

* Edit 1: I have reported this to the French authorities (Though I am a USA resident I dont think anything will happen with it).  I appreciate the kind words. 

* Edit 2: Any french law enforcement or lawyers that want to help?

* Edit 3: After searching ""BTCP Wallet"" the reddit post came up > https://i.imgur.com/7hT0nCL.png The user  https://www.reddit.com/user/jhkansen1 posted about it that it ""was already available"", I realize this was my fault for not fact checking this.

* Edit 4: User is spending the BTC now > https://live.blockcypher.com/btc/address/1EgaeuKXBs1kJGx68JtqhxeDGLsAxkDfbx/ 5.0 sent to address https://live.blockcypher.com/btc/address/17PJew5bTxscbFGpL6MFTmZMM95mvjNFJL/

* Edit 5: should I even bother reporting this to the FBI / police? Will they try to pin me for fraud or something for not reporting buying BTC? (crazy I know but I dont want a double hit here...)

* Edit 6: It looks like user (jhkansen1) here on Reddit (https://www.reddit.com/user/jhkansen1) is alerting everyone to navigate to the scam website.  **Can I get in contact to find his IP / authorities?** https://i.imgur.com/pk0Tw7r.png - it looks like its the same user that scammed people out of BCH and BTG - the same websites that are using the ""electrum X . org/com"" variables.  These scammers seem to be pretty big and unconfronted, which doesnt make me feel good about where things are in the crypto realm.

* Edit 7: Friendly and nice advice from an investing group on how to track / what to do:
>@Kainzo sorry to hear this. I‚Äôm sure you know this information already but watch these wallets carefully (below). They contain all your BTC. Try to see if you can set reminders or notifications on them to monitor activity. These wallets contain all your BTC (they won‚Äôt add up to the same amount due to transaction fees). The pattern of the transfers definitely seem programmatic so I doubt you are the only victim. That being said, the scammers are human, too. Not sure if they‚Äôll HODL or want to liquidate in this dip. If they liquidate, then they will either 1) send to an exchange (you‚Äôll be able to identify wallet addresses that are linked to an exchange so keep an eye out for activity) in which case once you notice the activity you should alert the exchange immediately, or 2) they will sell it off locally with a platform like local bitcoins, in which case it will be highly improbable to trace. If it is option 1, if the exchange cooperated with you, then you may be able to retrieve your lost funds. Fiat-to-coin exchanges like Coinbase should be on your side as they are under strict regulation to avoid processing dirty money, and they are well aware of this. I doubt, though, that the scammers will go the online dump route, due to the transparency and risk I just mentioned, but at this point it‚Äôs still worth the watch. Even if they go on some other exchange, still contact the exchange immediately. Because in that case they may be trying to transfer out in something like Ethereum, and you will have no way of tracking it once it leaves the exchange.

>@Kainzo wallet addresses associated with exchanges will usually be dumped into a central wallet owned by the exchange or some subwallet that is also owned by the exchange, which contains other people‚Äôs bitcoin too. If blockchain.info recognizes the address it will display which exchanges wallet it is. If not you can try to google the wallet address you suspect to be and exchange and it should provide some transparency.
You can try to alert authorities to identify the user who stole from you but it is unlikely they will be able to do anything about it since the scammer probably resides outside your country and law enforcement only has jurisdiction within, unless your case is escalated to some FBI equivalent in France
Even so, it is unlikely they will escalate or prosecute for a financial crime this size. Not saying $70k is small by any means, but the type of cases they deal with are more money laundering to the extent of millions

How much longer are we going to pretend we don't have an issue?,7jqs9m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7jqs9m/how_much_longer_are_we_going_to_pretend_we_dont/,"Hi everyone - huge bitcoin supporter here. I spend a lot of my time debating over in the other subreddit with BCH supporters because I believe BCH is a poor idea that is eventually going to lead to centralization, which Bitcoin can never succumb to. 

Over the past year, as bitcoin has become mainstream, we have all witnessed the price skyrocket and have all, in my opinion, become blinded by it. Bitcoin's has a MAJOR issue right now. Simply, day by day, wallets that have less than the minimum amount of satoshi/byte fee that will get a confirm in them are essentially useless/worthless. Also, any form of commerce for bitcoin is essentially impractical now. I was absolutely alarmed when in an interview, Jimmy Song was forced to answer what he would use as ""currency"" if he had to use it for an online transaction, and he said ""Visa"". I immediately realized just how absurd and hard headed the bitcoin community has become in this blocksize debate. People would rather push others wanting to purchase things online with Visa than to improve bitcoin immediately. My main issue with the current state of affairs in bitcoin is that we have lots of people offering us promises, but no immediately solutions. LN has been talked about for years now. So, what are we supposed to do... sit around and HOPE LN is immediately adopted when it comes out and everyone starts using it for low/no fees? I think.... no I KNOW one day it will be adopted, basically making all other cryptos obsolete. However, how far off is this? 1, 2, 3, 4 years? Nobody knows. But in the immediate/short future, what is the bitcoin community supposed to do? Sit around and pretend that $10 fees to make a simple transaction are OK? What happens if other cryptos decide to fill in that vacuum while we sat around waiting for LN, which by the way is not guaranteed to fix this fee issue. Even with LN, most smart people agree that at some point Bitcoin HAS to increase the blocksize. On LN, you still have to be opening/closing channels, plus people are always going to want to use the main blockchain to do transactions for maximum security. 

I think it's time the community backs a blocksize increase. We KNOW it has to happen at some point, so why not now? Bitcoin is in a very desperate place. Don't be fooled by this massive price spike. We have to make some serious decisions about what we are gonna do now to fix this. Sit around and wait for LN, or do the inevitable now, and increase the blocksize to 2mb. I'm officially putting my vote in for an immediate blocksize increase to 2mb. 

Discuss and please keep it civil.",1513276224.0,1966,chazley,1,btc,1

85% of passengers make a remark about the sign and are suprised to see it. They say I am the first person they have seen that accepts Bitcoin as payment.

Nearly all of those passenger have heard of it prior to seeing the sign but are confused about it and have been wrongly informed. Common remarks are ""how do you give me change from a $10,000 coin?"" ""It's easy for hackers to steal all the coins"" ""how do you even pay with Bitcoin?"".

As a Bitcoin/crypto supporter I feel I need to do my part in educating people and keep spreading the good word of our Bitcoin overlord.

Signal from all the noise today,7lh94q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7lh94q/signal_from_all_the_noise_today/,"Lets clear out few things based on whats happening today.

1) The price drop has nothing to do with anything. This is a standard Quarterly Ethnic cleansing of all noobs who came to double their money in a month. We see 30-40 % correction regularly. If you can't stomach it .. GTFO

2) Roger's Shitcoin is nothing more than a centralized pump and dump scheme. Its led by some really shady people and has actually never been battle tested. If it didn't have Bitcoin in its name then it would be trading at 5 $.

3) But we do need to recognize that we have a serious mempool issue. We can't honestly preach people that they can buy fraction of Bitcoin or that Bitcoin can solve problems in Venezuela if it bloody takes 30 $ to send a 5 $ worth of Bitcoin.

There have been studies which show that doubling the Lane size simply doubles the traffic. That will happen here too if we increase the blocksize. But problem here is that we need to survive for 2 years till we have proper long term solution which has been tested like we did for Segwit. 

I work in Tech startups as a developer. I supported the Core team over the whole 2X crises because it seemed like a hostile takeover by others over the repo and Dev team. But we need to recognize that ground reality in last 6 months has changed. We have 10X more people now. I have a complete crypto Boner for LN right now but honestly if I was working on a startup which was growing at 10-20X per year and I said that a scaling solution would come in 2 years .. I would be fired the same day.

As a developer, 2nd layer solutions make complete sense to me. Its like Horizontal vs Vertical scaling but at what mempool size do we realize that we have a problem which we need to address. 



Rant Over.

Edit: To the kind soul who gave me Reddit Gold. Thank you , I don't really deserve it. I actually feel ashamed. I have been part of this community from Early 2013 without any contributions.

Some words for my friends,1yv6ph,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1yv6ph/some_words_for_my_friends/,"Hello friends,

MtGox is gone. So let's prepare ourselves. 

On Tuesday, and for the rest of the week, all hell will break lose in the media. It will be blamed on MtGox, it will be blamed on Bitcoin, it will be blamed on the ""bug,"" and it will, more than anything, be blamed on the ""lack of regulation."" Pundits and ""experts"" of all types will weigh in on the calamity. It will be world news in a matter of hours.

Get ready, because it will be an ugly week. 

For all of you who lost money, my heart goes out to you.  Some people lost a little, some lost a fortune. It will make people sick, and depressed, and full of grief. Personally, I had over 550 BTC in Gox. I will never get any of that back. If misery loves company, then we'll be enjoying a grand feast today.

I should have known better, of course. I take responsibility for leaving those funds with an entity that had proven incompetence repeatedly. I chose to ignore even my own warnings, for nothing more than the sake of convenience. 

Gox is still at fault, to be sure, but I have learned the lesson. I hope it is not such an expensive lesson for others. And for all you observers, please take a moment to consider it as well.

Be mindful, however, that the wrong lessons are not learned, for that would be the true tragedy, indeed.

Let me suggest that the lesson is not that Bitcoin is broken. Bitcoin is fine.

Similarly, the lesson is not that security is impossible. Those who know what they are doing, can achieve it and help others to do so.

The lesson is not that nobody can be trusted. There are countless good men and women in this community who are worthy of trust, and some of the very best people I've ever met.

And finally, the lesson is not that we ought to seek out ""regulation"" to save us from the evils and incompetence of man. For the regulators are men too, and wield the very same evil and incompetence, only enshrined in an authority from which it can wreck amplified and far more insidious destruction. Let us not retreat from our rising platform only to cower back underneath the deranged machinations of Leviathan.

The proper lesson, if I may suggest, is this: We are building a new financial order, and those of us building it, investing in it, and growing it, will pay the price of bringing it to the world. This is the harsh truth. We are building the channels, the bridges, and the towers of tomorrow's finance, and we put ourselves at risk in doing so. 

We are at risk from accidents. We are at risk from fraud, from corruption, and from evil. We are at risk from journalists seeking headlines and from politicians seeking power and glory. We are at risk from the very market we are trying to build - a market which cares not about our portfolio, our ambitions, or our delicate sympathies. 

For all these risks, devastation will befall us repeatedly. Some of us will be discouraged. Some will be ridiculed and insulted. Some will be tricked, or swindled. Some of us will be crushed or caged. We will be set upon by all manner of antagonists, repeatedly, for a long time.

So why do we do it?  Why do we build these towers that fall down upon us? Why do we toil and strain and risk our precious time, which is the only real wealth we possess? 

Because the world needs what we're building. It needs it desperately. If that matters to you, as it does to me, then hold to that thought. You will see through the smoke, and your wounds will heal.

So shake it off, brothers, for this won't be the last calamity endured before the win.

Tonight, my heart is with you all. 

Tomorrow, my head is down. My eyes are open. And I am building.

Toward peace and freedom,

I have been slowly converting them to cash with random buyers etc....Besides the few charge-backs and scumbags it has gone over well....I now have enough money to live the rest of my life off of if I am careful.....Funny to think that in 2016 I was flat broke and had nothing to my name. I will be honest the long drawn out process of changing them into cash is tiring and I still have plenty left in my wallets.....I just wanted to ask if the community would be interested in a kind of scavenger hunt for a few wallets I have loaded with some BTC...Possibly jsut to bring people together and spread what is left to those who can no longer afford to get bitcoins or whatever....If you guys are interested, upvote or just let me know...I plan on making it fun...btw i went out yesterday and bought a few troy ounces of gold I was going to throw into the crates I plan on hiding these in.....I can only do U.S i cannot travel to europe.....


EDIT: Sweet....give me a few days to get stuff together. Ill do somthing online too for the international community...lets hope they keep going up and dont plummet like they did today.

EDIT2: I cannot say where in the U.S that would make it too easy lol. Also, too all you guys saying its fake....ok I love you all the same. I am just trying to give back. I choose this way because it is anonymous and no one will ever know who I am. I do not want attention on a personal level. I want people to come together towards a common goal. I love seeing people happy. I have seen anger and violence my whole life and I am tired of it. If this means someone can give their wife a new house, or their husband a new car or their kids a good education. I have accomplished my goal. I have one life to give and live, and my actions define who I am, not my wealth. In the end money is just numbers and means nothing when you die. If you want to participate....cool, if not....cool.

Segregated Witness (SegWit) was activated on the Bitcoin network August 24 2017 as a soft fork that is backward compatible with previous bitcoin transactions ([Understanding Segregated Witness](https://thewalletgenius.com/understanding-segwit-segregated-witness/)). Since that time wallets and exchanges have been slow to deploy SegWit, and the majority of users have not made the switch themselves.

On Dec 18 2017 Subhan Nadeem has pointed out that:
 [If every transaction in the Bitcoin network was a SegWit transaction today, blocks would contain up to 8,000 transactions, and the 138,000 unconfirmed transaction backlog would disappear instantly. Transaction fees would be almost non-existent once again](https://hackernoon.com/bitcoin-owners-you-need-to-do-these-two-things-right-now-a73122dd23d4). 

Mass SegWit use alone could empty the mempool, result in blocks that are not completely full, and make it possible to include transactions with $0 fee once again. 

[On Jan 11 2018 when BTC sends went offline at Coinbase the mempool began to rapidly empty. Later in the day when service was restored there was a sharp spike up in the mempool](https://twitter.com/JordanTuwiner/status/951698069967589376). Subsequently, that afternoon Brian Armstrong finally had to break his silence on the topic and admitted Coinbase is working on SegWit but has still not deployed it. It appears that this is an important data point that indicates if just a few major exchanges would deploy SegWit the high fees bitcoin is experiencing would be eliminated.

SegWit is just one technique available to exchanges and users to reduce pressure on the Bitcoin network. You can make the switch to SegWit on your next transaction, and pressure exchanges to deploy SegWit NOW along with other actions that will reduce their transaction impact on the network. You can help by taking one or more of the action steps below. 

________________


**ACTION STEPS**

1. If your favorite wallet has not yet implemented SegWit, kindly ask them to do so immediately. If your wallet is not committed to implementing SegWit fast, speak out online any way you can and turn up the pressure. In the meantime start using a wallet that has already implemented SegWit.
2. If your favorite exchange has not yet implemented SegWit, try to avoid making any further purchases of bitcoin at that exchange and politely inform them that if they do not enable SegWit within 30-days they will lose your business. Sign-up for an account at a SegWit deployed/ready exchange now and initiate the verification process so you'll be ready to bail
3. Help educate newcomers to bitcoin about the transaction issue, steer them towards SegWit wallets from day one, and encourage them to avoid ever purchasing bitcoin through non-SegWit ready exchanges that are harming bitcoin.
4. Spread the word! Contact individuals, websites, etc that use bitcoin, explain the benefits of SegWit to everyone, and request they make the switch. Use social media to point out the benefits of SegWit adoption.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The mempool is currently still quite backlogged. If you are a long-term holder and really have no reason to move your bitcoins at this time, wait until the mempool starts to clear and transaction fees go down before moving your bitcoins to a SegWit address or SegWit friendly exchange.

**BEYOND SEGWIT - BATCHING, PAYMENT CHANNELS, LIGHTNING**


Batching is another great way that exchanges can reduce their fees. See: [Saving up to 80% on Bitcoin transaction fees by batching payments](https://bitcointechtalk.com/saving-up-to-80-on-bitcoin-transaction-fees-by-batching-payments-4147ab7009fb). Despite the benefits of batching, some exchanges have been slow to implement it. Users should demand this or walk.

Beyond SegWit & Batching, Lightning Network integration will have even more effect. Lightning is now active and exchanges could setup payment channels between each other so that on-chain transactions need not take place. Some ideas have to outline how that might work are here: [Google Doc - Lightning Exchanges](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r38-_IgtfOkhJh4QbN7l6bl7Rol05qS-i7BjM3AjKOQ/edit). Which two bitcoin exchanges will be the first to establish a lightning channel between themselves and offer free/instant transfers between them for their customers? This will happen in 2018

**FAQs**

###### If I'm a HODLer, will it help to send my BTC to a SegWit address now?

> No, just get ready now so that your NEXT transaction will be to a SegWit wallet. Avoid burdening the network with any unnecessary transactions for now. 

###### Why is SegWit adoption going so slowly? Is it a time-consuming process, is there risk involved, is it laziness, or something else?

> SegWit will require some extra work to be done right and securely. Also, most exchanges let the user pay the fee, and up to now users have not been overly concerned about fees so for some exchanges it hasn't been a priority.

###### Once Segwit is FULLY adopted, what do we see the fees/transaction times going to?

> Times stay the same - fees will go down. How much and for how long depends on what the demand for transactions will be at that time.

###### What determines bitcoin transaction fees, to begin with?

> Fees are charged per byte of data and are bid up by users. Miners will typically include the transaction with the highest fee/byte first. 

###### Can you please tell me how to move my bitcoins to SegWit address in Bitcoin core wallet? Does the sender or receiver matter? 

> The Bitcoin core wallet does not yet have a GUI for its SegWit functionality. Download the latest version of Electrum to generate a SegWit address.

> A transaction between two SegWit addresses is a SegWit transaction. 

> A transaction sent from a SegWit address to a non-SegWit address is a SegWit transaction.

> A transaction sent from a non-SegWit address to a SegWit address is NOT a SegWit transaction. You can send a SegWit Tx if the sending address is a SegWit address.

> [Source: HowToToken](https://howtotoken.com/explained/send-bitcoin-faster-cheaper-SegWit-transactions)

###### What wallet are you using to ""batch your sends""? And how can I do that?

> Using Electrum, the ""Tools"" menu option: ""Pay to many"".

> Just enter your receive addresses and the amounts for each, and you can send multiple transactions for nearly the price of one.

###### Why doesn't the Core Wallet yet support SegWit?
 
> The Core Wallet supports SegWit, but its GUI doesn't. The next update will likely have GUI support built-in
 
###### Why isn't a large exchange like Coinbase SegWit ready & deployed when much smaller exchanges already are? Why do they default to high fees? Where is the leadership there?

> Draw your own conclusions based on their own words: 

> [March 2016 - Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has reservations about Core](https://blog.coinbase.com/what-happened-at-the-satoshi-roundtable-6c11a10d8cdf)

> [Dec 2017 - Coinbase is STILL working on Segwit](https://blog.coinbase.com/bitcoin-segwit-update-3ab0484e4526)

**P2SH/bech32 FAQs**

###### What are the two SegWit address formats and why do they exist?

> It's been a challenge for wallet developers to implement SegWit in a way that users can easily and without too much disruption migrate from legacy to SegWit addresses. The first wallets to enable SegWit addresses ‚Äì Ledger, Trezor, Core, GreenAddress ‚Äì use so-called ‚Äúnested P2SH addresses.‚Äù This means they take the existing Pay 2 Script Hash address ‚Äì starting with a ‚Äú3‚Äù ‚Äì and put a SegWit address into it. This enables a high grade of compatibility to exist wallets as every wallet is familiar with these addresses, but it is a workaround which results in SegWit transactions needing around 10 percent more space than they otherwise would.

> Electrum 3.0 was the first wallet to use bech32 addresses instead of nested p2sh addresses.

>  [Source: BTCManager.com](https://btcmanager.com/electrum-3-0-first-wallet-enable-bech32-segwit-addresses/)

###### What is the difference in address format between SegWit address formats P2SH and bech32?

> P2SH starts with ""3...""

> bech32 starts with ""bc1...""
 
###### Which addresses can I send from/to?

> P2SH Segwit addresses can be sent to using older Bitcoin software with no Segwit support. This supports backward compatibility

> bech32 can only be sent to from newer Bitcoin software that support bech32. Ex: Electrum

> [Source: BitcoinTalk.org](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2347427.msg23976364#msg23976364)

###### Why did ThePirateBay put up two Bitcoin donation addresses on their frontpage, one bech32 and one not? 

> The address starting with a ""3..."" is a P2SH SegWit address that can be sent BTC from any bitcoin address including a legacy address. The address starting with a ""bc1..."" is a bech32 SegWit address that can only be sent to from newer wallets that support bech32.

Throughout the outage‚Äî e.g. as early as the 8th‚Äî they've been making a small number of what looks like dust sweeping transactions.

One shown right now is TXID ed7ffa58fef651adaf1281ad10e98a4399eb2be40950345c7ccb7c8f76f067e1   which spends

Because the rules of the Bitcoin protocol prohibit spending coinbase txn with under 100 confirmations this transaction is currently invalid and will remain invalid for another 38 blocks.

un fucking believable. I think many of us are starting to realize now's the time for the Bitcoin community to go on offense. Enough playing defense and responding to clowns like this.

Let's give ZDNet the Western Union treatment. Read that article. It's insane. 

from the ""Journalist's"" article:
""Earlier this year, I wrote to a dozen or so key Senators and Congressmen concerning the illegality of Bitcoin in the United States. What makes it illegal is Article 1, Section 8, Clause 5 of the Constitution of the United States. Only the US Treasury can coin currency. If the US government doesn't produce currency, it is illegal. End of story. Now you have the confirmation from a US Senator to prove it.

I originally wrote to these people to have an opportunity to testify in front of Congress against Bitcoin's use in the US as a currency. Bitcoin is only one of a dozen or so illegal currencies, but Bitcoin seems to be the main one to battle against. If that one's defeated, then it would render all of them as worthless, except for their original purpose of illegal purchases of weapons, drugs, and other contraband.

My response from Senator Coburn's office is given below, in its entirety.""

Segregrated Witness (SegWit) was activated on the Bitcoin network August 24, 2017 as a soft fork that is backward compatible with previous bitcoin transactions ([Understanding Segregated Witness](https://thewalletgenius.com/understanding-segwit-segregated-witness/)). Since that time wallets and exchanges have been slow to deploy SegWit, some admitting in December 2017 that they have not even started work. If users demand SegWit now it will temporarily releive the transaction backlog while bigger solutions like Lightning are developed.

**BACKGROUND**

Subhan Nadeem has pointed out that:

[If every transaction in the Bitcoin network was a SegWit transaction today, blocks would contain up to 8,000 transactions, and the 138,000 unconfirmed transaction backlog would disappear instantly. Transaction fees would be almost non-existent once again](https://hackernoon.com/bitcoin-owners-you-need-to-do-these-two-things-right-now-a73122dd23d4). 

A few thousand bitcoin users from /r/Bitcoin switching to making their next transactions SegWit transactions will help take pressure off the network now, and together we can encourage exchanges/wallets to rapidly deploy SegWit for everyone ASAP. Let's make 80%+ SegWit happen fast. You can help by taking one or more of the action steps below. 

___________________

**ACTION STEPS**

1. If your favorite wallet has not yet implemented SegWit, kindly ask them to do so immediately. In the meantime start using a wallet that has already implemented SegWit. 
2. If your favorite exchange has not yet implemented SegWit, try to avoid making any further purchases of bitcoin at that exchange and politely inform them that if they do not enable SegWit within 30-days they will lose your business. Sign-up for an account at a SegWit deployed/ready exchange now and initiate the verification process so you'll be ready to bail
3. Help educate newcomers to bitcoin about the transaction issue, steer them towards SegWit wallets from day one, and encourage them to avoid ever purchasing bitcoin through non-SegWit ready exchanges that are harming bitcoin.
4. Spread the word! Conact individuals, websites, etc that use bitcoin, explain the benefits of SegWit to everyone, and request they make the switch

IMPORTANT NOTE: The mempool is currently still quite backlogged. If you are a long-term holder and really have no reason to move your bitcoins at this time, wait until the mempool starts to clear and transaction fees go down before moving your bitcoins to a SegWit address or SegWit friendly exchange.

**FAQs**

If I'm a HODLer, will it help to send my BTC to a SegWit address now?

- No, just get ready now so that your NEXT transaction will be to a SegWit wallet. Avoid burdening the network with any unneccessary transactions for now. 

Can you please tell me how to move my bitcoins to SegWit address in Bitcoin core wallet? Does the sender or receiver matter? 

- The Bitcoin core wallet does not yet have a GUI for its SegWit functionality. Download Electrum v3.0.3 to generate a SegWit address.

 A transaction between two SegWit addresses is a SegWit transaction. 

 A transaction sent from a SegWit address to a non-SegWit address is a SegWit transaction.

 A transaction sent from a non-SegWit address to a SegWit address is NOT a SegWit transaction. You can send a SegWit Tx if the sending address is a SegWit address.

 [Source](https://howtotoken.com/explained/send-bitcoin-faster-cheaper-SegWit-transactions)

What wallet are you using to ""batch your sends""? And how can I do that?

- Using Electrum, the ""Tools"" menu option: ""Pay to many"".

 Just enter your receive addresses and the amounts for each, and you can send multiple transactions for nearly the price of one.

Why doesn't the Core Wallet yet support SegWit?
 
 - The Core Wallet supports SegWit, but its GUI doesn't. The next update will likely have GUI support built-in
 
Why isn't a large exchange like Coinbase SegWit ready & deployed when much smaller exchanges already are? Why do they default to high fees? Where is the leadership there?

- Draw your own conclusions based on their own words:

"$100,000 bounty for software platform that can replace the Bitcoin Foundation",25sf4f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/25sf4f/100000_bounty_for_software_platform_that_can/,"Hi Everyone,

My name is Olivier Janssens, early adopter and Bitcoin millionaire.  The Bitcoin foundation has had its role in the last 2 years.  Unfortunately, it is internally recreating the same archaic political system that fails to work for society.  Bitcoin is the currency of the internet generation.  It puts the power back into the hands of the people.  You cannot expect its main representative organisation to be exactly the opposite: A non-transparent, political and secretive elite.  We have been trying to push the BF for transparency and clear communication for years, without result.  Meanwhile they started creating even more political structures inside, such as committees, which can only be accessed by knowing the right people.  At the bitcoin 2014 conference, organised by this same organisation, I expected to see full internet participation + live streaming of their events.  Especially of the BF member meeting, where they are supposed to get input from their members and disclose what they have been up to.  Instead, the board decided that the event is not to be recorded or broadcasted.  We have also no idea or say on how our money is spent.  Half of their board gets elected by industry members (a group of about 100 companies), and recently lead to another extremely controversial election of Brock Pierce, which has a history of being connected to cases involving fraud and pedophilia.  This needs to stop.  

We as an internet community, don‚Äôt need public figures to decide what‚Äôs good for us.  We need to stop politicking and start focussing on the projects directly.  For example, we need a project to fund the core development of bitcoin, and put our money straight to that.  We need a project to have lobbyists in Washington, to fight the anti-bitcoin lobbyists from Mastercard, and to prevent the government from destroying the currency.  Basically, we don‚Äôt need another intermediary.  We can do this ourselves.  Therefor, I want to announce today that I am organising a contest and giving $100k USD in BTC, to the group that can come up with the best platform to make this happen.  I am thinking of a system where prominent people can voice their opinion, where people can propose projects, and where the core devs can actively show their roadmap with detailed features + costs, and where we can vote on the features being implemented by sending bitcoins towards the feature of our choice.  This will allow the core dev team to expand by being able to add/pay more devs for feature requests which are fully funded.  Maybe we can even evolve to a system later where anyone can work on a feature, which, when programmed properly (approved by the core team), will receive the bounty.  The same applies to lobbyists, we just send bitcoins towards the one that we consider the most competent for the job.  This will allow Bitcoin to grow and expand at a rate it deserves, a rate that a political organisation such as the foundation can never accomplish.  

Let‚Äôs liberate bitcoin.

Olivier

Rules of the contest:

- Anyone can participate
- Software will be open sourced

Goodbye Coinbase.,7py0gk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7py0gk/i_just_transferred_out_my_funds_i_can_no_longer/,"I really can not stand how they are handling Bitcoin. It is clear they do not want a truly decentralized system to flourish, despite what their framework says. 

I am not a fan of secret agendas and greedy hands. It is possible to make money and be respectable, but Coinbase has chosen a different path. 

It saddens me because Coinbase was my entry point into crypto, and now I feel they've aligned themselves against what the entire system should stand for. 

Goodbye Coinbase. For your sake, I hope you can redeem yourself. But for now, you are losing a customer for a company with standards and values that actually reflect in their actions.

Edit: For anyone wanting to do the same. https://support.coinbase.com/customer/portal/articles/2063066-how-can-i-close-my-account-

A Few reasons: The way they handled the release of Bcash [(Roger Ver defended the Insider Trading)](https://www.ccn.com/insider-trading-non-crime-roger-ver-bites-back-gdax-re-opens-bitcoin-cash-trading/), The CEO Brian Armstrong is [clearly against Bitcoin](https://twitter.com/Tom_Horvath/status/949207156338946048), They have yet to implement segwit in a timely manner.  It is clear to me they would like to make money over sticking to their standards and values. As stated above, it is possible to do both. 

Another: [Spamming the network](http://bitcoinist.com/mempool-coinbase-spamming-bitcoin/)

Bitcoin users can help lower transaction fees and improve bitcoin by switching to SegWit addresses and encourage wallets/exchanges to do the same.

**SUMMARY**

Segregated Witness (SegWit) was activated on the Bitcoin network August 24 2017 as a soft fork that is backward compatible with previous bitcoin transactions ([Understanding Segregated Witness](https://thewalletgenius.com/understanding-segwit-segregated-witness/)). Since that time wallets and exchanges have been slow to deploy SegWit, some admitting in December 2017 that they have not even started work on integrating it. Others, such as Zebpay in India [have already implemented SegWit](https://blog.zebpay.com/how-zebpay-reduced-bitcoin-transaction-fees-a9e24c788598) and are reaping the benefits of reduced transaction fees. If bitcoin users demand SegWit now it will temporarily relieve the transaction backlog while more even more advanced solutions such as Lightning are developed.

Batching is another great way that exchanges can reduce their fees. See: [Saving up to 80% on Bitcoin transaction fees by batching payments](https://bitcointechtalk.com/saving-up-to-80-on-bitcoin-transaction-fees-by-batching-payments-4147ab7009fb). Despite the benefits of batching, some exchanges have been slow to implement it.

There is an opportunity now for all bitcoin users to individually contribute to help strengthen and improve the bitcoin protocol. At this point, the process requires a bit of work/learning on the part of the user, but in doing so you'll actually be advancing bitcoin and leaving what could turn out to be a multi-generational legacy for humanity.

**BACKGROUND**

On Dec 18 Subhan Nadeem has pointed out that:

[If every transaction in the Bitcoin network was a SegWit transaction today, blocks would contain up to 8,000 transactions, and the 138,000 unconfirmed transaction backlog would disappear instantly. Transaction fees would be almost non-existent once again](https://hackernoon.com/bitcoin-owners-you-need-to-do-these-two-things-right-now-a73122dd23d4). 

A few thousand bitcoin users from /r/Bitcoin switching to making their next transactions SegWit transactions will help take pressure off the network now, and together we can encourage exchanges/wallets to rapidly deploy SegWit for everyone ASAP. Let's make 80%+ SegWit happen fast. You can help by taking one or more of the action steps below. 

___________________

**ACTION STEPS**

1. If your favorite wallet has not yet implemented SegWit, kindly ask them to do so immediately. In the meantime start using a wallet that has already implemented SegWit. 
2. If your favorite exchange has not yet implemented SegWit, try to avoid making any further purchases of bitcoin at that exchange and politely inform them that if they do not enable SegWit within 30-days they will lose your business. Sign-up for an account at a SegWit deployed/ready exchange now and initiate the verification process so you'll be ready to bail
3. Help educate newcomers to bitcoin about the transaction issue, steer them towards SegWit wallets from day one, and encourage them to avoid ever purchasing bitcoin through non-SegWit ready exchanges that are harming bitcoin.
4. Spread the word! Conact individuals, websites, etc that use bitcoin, explain the benefits of SegWit to everyone, and request they make the switch

IMPORTANT NOTE: The mempool is currently still quite backlogged. If you are a long-term holder and really have no reason to move your bitcoins at this time, wait until the mempool starts to clear and transaction fees go down before moving your bitcoins to a SegWit address or SegWit friendly exchange.

**FAQs**

If I'm a HODLer, will it help to send my BTC to a SegWit address now?

- No, just get ready now so that your NEXT transaction will be to a SegWit wallet. Avoid burdening the network with any unneccessary transactions for now. 

Why is SegWit adoption going so slowly? Is it a time-consuming process, is there risk involved, is it laziness, or something else?

- SegWit will require some extra work to be done right and securely. Also, most exchanges let the user pay the fee, and up to now users have not been overly concerned about fees so for some exchanges it hasn't been a priority.

Once Segwit is FULLY adopted, what do we see the fees/transaction times going to?

- Times stay the same - fees will go down. How much and for how long depends on what the demand for transactions will be at that time.

What determines bitcoin transaction fees, to begin with?

- Fees are charged per byte of data and are bid up by users. Miners will typically include the transaction with the highest fee/byte first. 

Can you please tell me how to move my bitcoins to SegWit address in Bitcoin core wallet? Does the sender or receiver matter? 

- The Bitcoin core wallet does not yet have a GUI for its SegWit functionality. Download Electrum v3.0.3 to generate a SegWit address.

 A transaction between two SegWit addresses is a SegWit transaction. 

 A transaction sent from a SegWit address to a non-SegWit address is a SegWit transaction.

 A transaction sent from a non-SegWit address to a SegWit address is NOT a SegWit transaction. You can send a SegWit Tx if the sending address is a SegWit address.

 [Source: HowToToken](https://howtotoken.com/explained/send-bitcoin-faster-cheaper-SegWit-transactions)

What wallet are you using to ""batch your sends""? And how can I do that?

- Using Electrum, the ""Tools"" menu option: ""Pay to many"".

 Just enter your receive addresses and the amounts for each, and you can send multiple transactions for nearly the price of one.

Why doesn't the Core Wallet yet support SegWit?
 
 - The Core Wallet supports SegWit, but its GUI doesn't. The next update will likely have GUI support built-in
 
Why isn't a large exchange like Coinbase SegWit ready & deployed when much smaller exchanges already are? Why do they default to high fees? Where is the leadership there?

- Draw your own conclusions based on their own words: 

 [March 2016 - Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has reservations about Core](https://blog.coinbase.com/what-happened-at-the-satoshi-roundtable-6c11a10d8cdf)

**P2SH/bech32 FAQs**

What are the two SegWit address formats and why do they exist?

- It's been a challenge for wallet developers to implement SegWit in a way that users can easily and without too much disruption migrate from legacy to SegWit addresses. The first wallets to enable SegWit addresses ‚Äì Ledger, Trezor, Core, GreenAddress ‚Äì use so-called ‚Äúnested P2SH addresses.‚Äù This means they take the existing Pay 2 Script Hash address ‚Äì starting with a ‚Äú3‚Äù ‚Äì and put a SegWit address into it. This enables a high grade of compatibility to existing wallets as every wallet is familiar with these addresses, but it is a workaround which results in SegWit transactions needing around 10 percent more space than they otherwise would.

 Electrum 3.0 was the first wallet to use bech32 addresses instead of nested p2sh addresses.

  [Source: BTCManager.com](https://btcmanager.com/electrum-3-0-first-wallet-enable-bech32-segwit-addresses/)

What is the difference in address format between SegWit address formats P2SH and bech32?

- P2SH starts with ""3...""

 bech32 starts with ""bc1...""
 
Which addresses can I send from/to?

- P2SH Segwit addresses can be sent to using older Bitcoin software with no Segwit support. This supports backwards compatibility

 bech32 can only be sent to from newer Bitcoin software that support bech32. Ex: Electrum

 [Source: BitcoinTalk.org](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2347427.msg23976364#msg23976364)

Why did ThePirateBay put up two Bitcoin donation addresses on their frontpage, one bech32 and one not? 

- The address starting with a ""3..."" is a P2SH SegWit address that can be sent BTC from any bitcoin address including a legacy address. The address starting with a ""bc1..."" is a bech32 SegWit address that can only be sent to from newer wallets that support bech32.

"Because I trade Bitcoin, I am no longer able to receive Gas or Electricity to my home.",6is76p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6is76p/because_i_trade_bitcoin_i_am_no_longer_able_to/,"TL;DR: A bank ban for trading Bitcoin has resulted in a system offered by Equifax to prevent me from holding an account with non banking related industries, such as a Gas Electricity Provider.

-----------------------

A few weeks ago, I posted a thread here showing a live update on my quest to open a bank account for my Bitcoin trading business here in Australia (OP: https://redd.it/6fl0i3).

While pretty much all of these application requests were denied, one bank did respond with an application form (Albeit, the email felt a bit generic - but figured I'd give it a try none the less)

I submitted my application and everything was going great.. Until I was informed that I had failed their ID verification process and to submit it again. It was an online form I had to fill out and I thought it was strange that it didnt request my ID information, just Name, DOB, address and phone number. I thought it may have been a glitch, so submitted the form again. Still no request for ID.

Two days later, I received a phone call from this bank, stating that my ID verification had been denied, as my details had been ""red flagged"" for fraudulent behaviour, and I would have to get this fixed up before submitting again. I was told to contact ""Equifax"" to get the issue resolved and that was that.

I Immediately contacted equifax (the recent purchaser of VEDA), and asked if I could speak to someone regarding a ""rejected ID verification"". After bouncing through a few people, it came apparent that no one had any idea as to what I was talking about, and that they only dealt with Credit Reports.

So I ordered my credit report (for me personally and my business) to see if there was anything on there to be concerned about. Nothing. Just some old credit card applications from 2013, and a car loan. No ""Red Flag"", No ""Suspicions activity reports"". Nothing.

By this point I thought maybe the bank was trying to shift the blame, so they could avoid the conversation of telling me they couldnt offer me a bank account because of my business nature. But before I made the phone call to them, I figured, a quick google search wouldnt help.

Sure enough, Equifax DOES have an ID verification system called IDMatrix - and as spotted, the bank I was dealing with was one of their clients, and a bank I had been BANNED from in the past was also a client.

Now that I had a name to the face, I called Equifax bank, and requested to speak to someone from IDMatrix, regarding some verification issues. The closest I got was speaking to someone from their sales team, who put me through to the credit report department, who put me through to ""customer service"", who put me back through to the IDMatrix sales department, who were then closed.

Getting no luck with the phone calls, I decided to draft up an email to IDMatrix, and sent another email to the bank, requesting they provide proof of this ID rejection, so I could send it onto IDMatrix, in case they try to stone wall me with ""We have no idea what youre talking about"" answers again.

When I was going through the IDMatrix website earlier, I noticed that they provided their services to non financial businesses as well (Such as a large Electricity and Gas Provider here in Australia). Out of curiosity, I started the application process to apply for a new electricity connection to my house, to see if the result would be any different to what the bank got. A few tick boxes later, and sure enough, I was not eligible for an electricity connection with them!

I was shocked. Dealing with bank bans was one thing, but dealing with the rejection from a basic household utilities company was another. What significance does my business activity have to a utilities provider? I'm sure they have no issue with providing electricity to hydroponic set ups, or a gas connection to a meth lab? At least ive never heard of electricity or gas being cut for that reason. I would assume they couldnt give two stuffs what they do in their spare time. But a Bitcoin Trader? Thats some risky business. (Yes I am aware this isnt the Utilities company's fault - rather IDMatrix's, just using the hypothetical for comparison).

To wrap this up, I have emailed my solicitor to get advice on the matter, and I'm not ""banking"" on much to receive any response from the bank in question or Equifax. But thanks for the vent reddit. Appreciate it.",1498149016.0,418,bitcoinbabeau,1,btc,1

"Arthur Nakamoto: My brother, Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto...",1zx9zj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1zx9zj/arthur_nakamoto_my_brother_dorian_satoshi_nakamoto/,"Mis-quoting and blatant lies are unfortunately the journalistic world that exists today. I am just a humble handsome Asian man who is confused as to how a female asshole can become transferred onto my brother's rear end. But I saw with my own eyes from released video that there is a surgeon operating without an ethical or moral license to do exactly that.

I and my immediate family were frightened due to obvious safety concerns, angered by our privacy being invaded and highly concerned over a gentle man trying, trying to recover from his life threatening health concerns. He was so private that he did not tell me when he was going through his health threats, only told me quietly when I visited the house in Temple City to take our mother for lunch. And I am his blood brother.

I recall as a child that I looked up to Dorian, who I believe is many times smarter than I am. He taught me as a toddler, protected me from harm, shared with me Manga, the Japanese comic books and made up fantastic stories til I fell asleep. I am forever indebted to him in saving my life when I was 9 years old. He probably doesn‚Äôt remember anymore, but I do and that‚Äôs what matters to me.  I called the writer an asshole and told her to leave my brother alone but the whole world did not read that, why?  Dorian can be stubborn and be an asshole but then I am telling the whole world right here and now that I and only 2 other people in the whole world can say that to him and we are automatically forgiven by him in an instant. He can call me an asshole too and has and maybe a few ‚Äúidiot‚Äù or ‚Äúmorons‚Äù, but you know, he was probably right and can prove it. That‚Äôs private. 

 How dare this Leah demean, belittle the comforts of an old man in poor health who has barely enough money to feed himself and takes gentle care of our 93 year old mother in a modest house. To act and publish with carefully studied thought along with professional profilers, editors who calculated greed to ultimately endanger my brother's health and his physical safety. To be callous enough to place the safety of our 93 year old mother as a person of no consequence? Their collective act that published their magazines and follow-up public reports speak volumes of the motivation tied to greed. Who is going to be responsible in their safety, her, the executives at Newsweek, the entire Journalistic community? Yes, I place Leah McGraw Goodman and Newsweek and all news organizations that had joined in the feeding frenzy to be held responsible for their blatant and open carelessness.

I understand that I will be mis-quoted in this post and that I will be made out to be the brother who is the asshole remark guy. I can and will have no choice that to be slandered and live with that.  What I want to make clear is that I am pleading, no, begging for all to allow Dorian to live whatever life he has left to live it in dignity, peace and in private. To let him play with his trains and obsess over being treated to free lunches that he craves for some reason since his stroke. Funny thing is that growing up we were always hungry because there was never enough and lunch was our largest meal. What do I have to do? Show everyone my bowl legs due to malnutrition? His legs which are worse? What lower level of indecency is required to quench their thirst for what I cannot fathom? 

Do you know what's a real bitch (I am welling with tears right now) is?   I cannot physically go to see him and my mother. To come together as a family to support or call for fear of my immediate family being in physical danger.  I can‚Äôt go over there to bring groceries or have a private discussion.

I have found a picture of me and my brother. I hope this evidence is more concrete.

After Roger Ver openly admitting that he will promote Bitcoin Cash as Bitcoin we all should report the website as a phishing site to google!,7jzpir,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7jzpir/after_roger_ver_openly_admitting_that_he_will/,"Source for the claim: https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7jg265/1000000_bitcoin_cash_wallets_have_now_been/dr6qf17/

Go here to report: https://safebrowsing.google.com/safebrowsing/report_phish/

Roger Ver's site: www.bitcoin.com

As pointed out by /u/codedaway below, you can also report /r/btc to reddit for violating reddit's self promotion rules.

Edit: as was pointed out by some, phishing might not be matching exactly. Wiki defines phishing as ""Phishing is the attempt to obtain sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details (and money), often for malicious reasons, by disguising as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication."". I think that the last part is the most important aspect. Roger Ver and thus Bitcoin.com seems to try to disguise - with their app and what Roger Ver wrote  in the linked comment - bitcoin cash as a trustworthy entity (bitcoin). In my books this is close enough to be counted as phishing. The means might be different but the intent is the same. Please decide for yourself.

In the end this is only a report - so google and reddit have to decide whether they are legit or not.",1513373578.0,627,goldendolphinjuice,1,btc,1

Please, don't say that. That's terrible mindset. It makes other people misunderstand. If you don't want to lose bitcoin before the price goes up, you just buy more bitcoin before or after you purchase something with bitcoin. Or sell your house for buying more bitcoin.

The real value of bitcoin depends on how many transactions that purchase with bitcoin. If nobody purchases anything with bitcoin, bitcoin will become worthless. Hodling or storing bitcoin never help the community anyway.

We have to promote trading bitcoin and purchasing with bitcoin.

I recommend purchasing with bitcoin at the store that discount when we paying with bitcoin. That's helping the store, help the community, and help the buyer at the same time.

*** Adding Something (Edit) ***

Yeah, I agree with someone. We shouldn't use bitcoin in stores where it is more expensive and high fee. We shouldn't support this business model.

BUT, But, But Using bitcoin helps adoption which increases the price of bitcoin. We need the benefits of bitcoin just to persuade merchants to accept it by using it. We can receive the benefit from bitcoin right now. Such as I use bitcoin for moving money abroad because it is the cheapest way. I still use bitcoin at stores that discount. Someone use bitcoin at dark markets. Someone use bitcoin to be paid by people who can not pay me cheaper by other ways.",1506366692.0,475,DekSingburi,1,btc,1

Antonopoulos' Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/aantonop/posts) (it's a public entry posted on 16th of December. The readability and formatting is better there btw):*

*Edit: direct link to the post: https://www.patreon.com/posts/emotional-15912702*  

----------------  




On December 6th, my life changed trajectory... again. I went to sleep on a wave of positive messages and support from the bitcoin community, in response to a letter I had posted on Patreon titled ‚ÄúIn defense of optimism‚Äù that had leaked to Reddit.
I had spent the day reading messages of support pouring in on Twitter, Patreon, and email, literally thousands of them. It was a life-affirming experience. Like everyone else on social media, the messages I receive are not always kind and supportive. Often the critical messages and trolls are far louder than the supporters. Our brains don't evaluate praise and criticism in equal measure - it's easy to believe the criticism and see the praise as undeserved. That‚Äôs why each little message of support makes a difference, each one helps me ignore the critics and see the impact of my work. In addition to all of the written messages, people were signing up to support me on Patreon and some were even sending bitcoin to my donation address. By the time I went to sleep, I was filled with gratitude, humbled by the overwhelmingly positive, viral response of the community. 

Here‚Äôs what happened next...

I wake up on December 7th, the notifications list on my phone was too long to scroll. Hundreds more messages of support had come in while I was asleep.

Then my phone rings and I recognize the number of a dear friend. ""Strange,"" I think. I‚Äôm not expecting a call. ""Don't open your laptop yet,"" she says. ""You got some big bitcoin donations overnight. Are you sitting down?"" I sit down. I open my laptop, I look at the balance in my 1andreas bitcoin donation address.

Surprise, gratitude, fear, shock, joy, elation, anxiety. My emotions achieved a level of volatility that mirrored that of the bitcoin exchange rate. Good thing I was sitting down.

You're probably thinking that between the supportive messages and the large donations, I‚Äôd have been celebrating without a care in the world. But I'm a security professional who works in bitcoin. Could I come up with a doomsday scenario to taint this experience? Hold my beer.

I'm in a taxi on the way to the airport. I‚Äôm cycling through emotions again, a bit faster now.

Joy, Terror, Tears, Gratitude, Fear, Elation, Dread, Cold Sweat. It's a good thing I'm sitting down. I can't feel my fingers.

Anxiety

Wouldn't it be ironic if I get hacked and this massive donation is stolen the same day it was given? *Shudder*. That was a real possibility. Funds were sent to a vanity address, posted on my website, which was mainly used to support my habit of giving small amounts of bitcoin to strangers at meetups and conferences. Before December 6th, the address typically received small gifts each month and I emptied it every now and then in a spree of small donations. 

Gratitude

I still can‚Äôt believe how many people have responded. I had no idea how many people could identify with the feelings expressed ‚ÄúIn defense of optimism‚Äù and would want to show their support. I‚Äôm grateful to be a part of this community.

Fear 

This vanity address is secured with a single private key which was stored on my phone in a ‚Äúhot‚Äù wallet, so that I can give away bitcoin at meetups. The address has maximum public visibility and no Segwit (segregated witness) support. My security model just tipped over and I'm freaking out.

Happiness

I‚Äôm so happy! This is incredible, unimaginable. My fingers are numb, in a good way. Is this really happening?!?

Cold Sweats

I have to move the funds out. Now. Right now. But I only have this key on a wallet that doesn't handle RBF (replace-by-fee), CPFP (child-pays-for-parent), and it's not a Segwit address. I'm traveling; I‚Äôm about to get on two long flights and the mempool is slammed with transactions. Of all the days!

Joy

I‚Äôm crying. Tears of joy. This is something most people never get to experience in the most meaningful of careers, a loud acknowledgement from an entire community and financial security. I‚Äôm thinking about my family members and close friends who are struggling and overjoyed at the opportunity I now have to help them. 

Terror

Then it dawns on me: a perfect nightmare scenario. What if this is considered ""income"" in the US and I have to pay taxes at a 39.6% rate? Those taxes would be evaluated on the USD value of the donation at the time it was made, at an all-time-high price of bitcoin. If bitcoin's bubble bursts by 50% today, I will owe more taxes than the donation is worth. I will be bankrupt but will owe the IRS and those debts can't be discharged in bankruptcy. I'm going to be in debt for a decade!

Elation

I can HODL! I don‚Äôt have to keep selling to pay bills. Patreon has grown too, so I should be able to cover my expenses and build the business with their support. I can really HODL!

[Alarm buzzes on my phone]

‚ÄúBoarding on Gate D15‚Äù. Pack everything back up, run to the gate. Find my seat. Unpack all my electronics. Re-establish connections. No Wifi yet. 3G if I hold my phone just so against the window. We're taking off. No Wifi at all on this flight. 4 hours, offline, me and my thoughts. What is the opposite of a state of mindfulness? Head spinning.

Fear

What if the price crashes. Should I sell some?

Silliness

I'm buying a lambo (I laugh out loud at the thought of that. No, I'd never waste money on something so silly).

Dread

What if the donations had zero fees and will never confirm? What if this was all a cruel joke? 

Joy

My dad will be so proud!

[Landed]

Turn on smartphone. Too many notifications. Turn on VPN, Tor. Sync wallet. Too slow. Too slow.

Run to the lounge. Get on Wifi. Fire up VPN, Tor. Start electrum. Import keys. Child-pays-for-parent the stuck transactions, Replace-by-fee new transactions. Careful coin selection. Send to cold storage (so glad I keep an unused cold storage address handy). Overpay fees more than ever before. 2000 satoshi per byte? Fuck yeah. This is the highest priority transaction of my life. 8 agonizing minutes. 1st block. Confirmations ripple down my screen. Exhaling... I hadn't noticed I was holding my breath.

‚ÄúBoarding gate C51‚Äù. Pack everything, run to the gate. Board the plane. Unpack everything. This flight has Wifi. Bet it doesn't work. Yup, it doesn't work. 6.5 hour flight. I'll just read a book. I've read the same paragraph 8 times and don't know what it says. I'll sleep. Nope. Ok fine, I'll fret - seems I'm good at that and nothing else right now.

[Landed]

That was the longest flight ever. Boot up, 4G, VPN, Tor. Sync.... slow, too slow.

ANOTHER GIANT DONATION. WTF! Is this really happening? Is my wallet counting the balance incorrectly? This isn't possible. WTF IS GOING ON?

Joy, Terror, Tears, Gratitude, Fear, Elation, Dread. I‚Äôm cycling faster now.

I just emptied my wallet into cold storage and now it's carrying a ridiculous amount again. Boot up, VPN, Tor, Electrum, CPFP, RBF, cold sweat, 1 confirmation. Phew.

I realize that I just conducted the 4 biggest transactions of my life. I'm shaking. Hope I didn't screw anything up.

Finally I get to my hotel. ‚ÄúLong day‚Äù doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe it. I am grateful, giddy, jetlagged and exhausted, so sleep should come easy, right? Not happening. Two hours of tossing and turning while my mind is racing. In the end I just pass out from exhaustion. I wake up in a state of anxiety. 

I open my inbox. I have a dozen interview requests from newspapers, TV, radio. They don‚Äôt want to talk about bitcoin. They want to talk about ‚Äúmy story.‚Äù It‚Äôs never been about ‚Äúmy story‚Äù and I‚Äôm not about to change that. Denied, denied, denied. That‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm going offline for a few days. I need time to process everything that has happened over the past couple of days and strategize about what to do next.

There are no words to adequately convey my appreciation, my gratitude. 

These are life-changing gifts, but I don‚Äôt intend to change my life. I‚Äôm highly suspicious and careful about ‚Äúlifestyle inflation‚Äù: I resist any urges to increase my spending as my income increases because as a self-employed entrepreneur I know my income can decrease significantly at any moment. 

First, the practical side: For legal and tax reasons the gifts should remain mostly untouched for at least three years. This is a new situation and no one knows for sure how the authorities will characterize it. I wanted to HODL anyway, so that‚Äôs fine with me.

Second, and the much more important side, I love what I do. I‚Äôm obviously not going to ‚Äúretire‚Äù or slow down. Receiving your messages and support has energized me and I‚Äôm excited to do more, much more. 

The number of people supporting me on Patreon has grown significantly and with that support I‚Äôll actually be able to do a lot more. And there are many things I want to do:  a new website with more materials, in as many formats and languages as possible; more books; an epic tour; and that‚Äôs just the beginning!  I also plan to grow my team, which serves two goals: I can get help for the things that need to be done, but I can also bring more people success and security with a steady paycheck.

While I‚Äôm excited about all of these new projects, I want you to know that the ultimate goal remains the same: to educate as many people as possible about this transformational technology and remain an independent voice, working directly for the community. 

A week has passed. The one feeling that keeps returning, among the barrage of feelings, is gratitude. After taking time to process and calm down, the fear and stress is gone and all that is left is gratitude. I am so thankful for all the messages of support. I am so touched to hear stories of how my work has affected others in a positive way. I am thankful for all the donors who rallied behind me to help me in my advocacy and education.
